Along with Li Bai ( Li Po ) , he is frequently called the greatest of the Chinese poets . His greatest ambition was to serve his country as a successful civil servant , but he proved unable to make the necessary accommodations . His life , like the whole country , was devastated by the An Lushan Rebellion of 755 , and his last 15 years were a time of almost constant unrest . \\n',\n"," ' Although initially he was little @-@ known to other writers , his works came to be hugely influential in both Chinese and Japanese literary culture . Of his poetic writing , nearly fifteen hundred poems have been preserved over the ages . He has been called the \" Poet @-@ Historian \" and the \" Poet @-@ Sage \" by Chinese critics , while the range of his work has allowed him to be introduced to Western readers as \" the Chinese Virgil , Horace , Ovid , Shakespeare , Milton , Burns , Wordsworth , Béranger , Hugo or Baudelaire \" . \\n',\n"," ' = = Life = = \\n',\n"," ' Traditional Chinese literary criticism emphasized the life of the author when interpreting a work , a practice which Burton Watson attributes to \" the close links that traditional Chinese thought posits between art and morality \" . Since many of Du Fu \\'s poems feature morality and history , this practice is particularly important . Another reason , identified by the Chinese historian William Hung , is that Chinese poems are typically concise , omitting context that might be relevant , but which an informed contemporary could be assumed to know . For modern Western readers , \" The less accurately we know the time , the place and the circumstances in the background , the more liable we are to imagine it incorrectly , and the result will be that we either misunderstand the poem or fail to understand it altogether \" . Stephen Owen suggests a third factor particular to Du Fu , arguing that the variety of the poet \\'s work required consideration of his whole life , rather than the \" reductive \" categorizations used for more limited poets . \\n',\n"," ' = = = Early years = = = \\n',\n"," \" Most of what is known of Du Fu 's life comes from his poems . His paternal grandfather was Du Shenyan , a noted politician and poet during the reign of Empress Wu . Du Fu was born in 712 ; the exact birthplace is unknown , except that it was near Luoyang , Henan province ( Gong county is a favourite candidate ) . In later life , he considered himself to belong to the capital city of Chang 'an , ancestral hometown of the Du family . \\n\",\n"," \" Du Fu 's mother died shortly after he was born , and he was partially raised by his aunt . He had an elder brother , who died young . He also had three half brothers and one half sister , to whom he frequently refers in his poems , although he never mentions his stepmother . \\n\",\n"," ' The son of a minor scholar @-@ official , his youth was spent on the standard education of a future civil servant : study and memorisation of the Confucian classics of philosophy , history and poetry . He later claimed to have produced creditable poems by his early teens , but these have been lost . \\n',\n"," \" In the early 730s , he travelled in the Jiangsu / Zhejiang area ; his earliest surviving poem , describing a poetry contest , is thought to date from the end of this period , around 735 . In that year , he took the civil service exam , likely in Chang 'an . He failed , to his surprise and that of centuries of later critics . Hung concludes that he probably failed because his prose style at the time was too dense and obscure , while Chou suggests his failure to cultivate connections in the capital may have been to blame . After this failure , he went back to traveling , this time around Shandong and Hebei . \\n\",\n"," \" His father died around 740 . Du Fu would have been allowed to enter the civil service because of his father 's rank , but he is thought to have given up the privilege in favour of one of his half brothers . He spent the next four years living in the Luoyang area , fulfilling his duties in domestic affairs . \\n\",\n"," ' In the autumn of 744 , he met Li Bai ( Li Po ) for the first time , and the two poets formed a friendship . David Young describes this as \" the most significant formative element in Du Fu \\'s artistic development \" because it gave him a living example of the reclusive poet @-@ scholar life to which he was attracted after his failure in the civil service exam . The relationship was somewhat one @-@ sided , however . Du Fu was by some years the younger , while Li Bai was already a poetic star . We have twelve poems to or about Li Bai from the younger poet , but only one in the other direction . They met again only once , in 745 . \\n',\n"," ' In 746 , he moved to the capital in an attempt to resurrect his official career . He took the civil service exam a second time during the following year , but all the candidates were failed by the prime minister ( apparently in order to prevent the emergence of possible rivals ) . He never again attempted the examinations , instead petitioning the emperor directly in 751 , 754 and probably again in 755 . He married around 752 , and by 757 the couple had had five children — three sons and two daughters — but one of the sons died in infancy in 755 . From 754 he began to have lung problems ( probably asthma ) , the first of a series of ailments which dogged him for the rest of his life . It was in that year that Du Fu was forced to move his family due to the turmoil of a famine brought about by massive floods in the region . \\n',\n"," \" In 755 , he received an appointment as Registrar of the Right Commandant 's office of the Crown Prince 's Palace . Although this was a minor post , in normal times it would have been at least the start of an official career . Even before he had begun work , however , the position was swept away by events . \\n\",\n"," ' = = = War = = = \\n',\n"," ' The An Lushan Rebellion began in December 755 , and was not completely suppressed for almost eight years . It caused enormous disruption to Chinese society : the census of 754 recorded 52 @.@ 9 million people , but ten years later , the census counted just 16 @.@ 9 million , the remainder having been displaced or killed . During this time , Du Fu led a largely itinerant life unsettled by wars , associated famines and imperial displeasure . This period of unhappiness was the making of Du Fu as a poet : Even Shan Chou has written that , \" What he saw around him — the lives of his family , neighbors , and strangers – what he heard , and what he hoped for or feared from the progress of various campaigns — these became the enduring themes of his poetry \" . Even when he learned of the death of his youngest child , he turned to the suffering of others in his poetry instead of dwelling upon his own misfortunes . Du Fu wrote : \\n',\n"," ' Brooding on what I have lived through , if even I know such suffering , the common man must surely be rattled by the winds . \\n',\n"," \" In 756 , Emperor Xuanzong was forced to flee the capital and abdicate . Du Fu , who had been away from the city , took his family to a place of safety and attempted to join the court of the new emperor ( Suzong ) , but he was captured by the rebels and taken to Chang 'an . In the autumn , his youngest son , Du Zongwu ( Baby Bear ) , was born . Around this time Du Fu is thought to have contracted malaria . \\n\",\n"," \" He escaped from Chang 'an the following year , and was appointed Reminder when he rejoined the court in May 757 . This post gave access to the emperor but was largely ceremonial . Du Fu 's conscientiousness compelled him to try to make use of it : he caused trouble for himself by protesting the removal of his friend and patron Fang Guan on a petty charge . He was arrested but was pardoned in June . He was granted leave to visit his family in September , but he soon rejoined the court and on December 8 , 757 , he returned to Chang 'an with the emperor following its recapture by government forces . However , his advice continued to be unappreciated , and in the summer of 758 he was demoted to a post as Commissioner of Education in Huazhou . The position was not to his taste : in one poem , he wrote : \\n\",\n"," ' I am about to scream madly in the office / Especially when they bring more papers to pile higher on my desk . \\n',\n"," ' He moved on in the summer of 759 ; this has traditionally been ascribed to famine , but Hung believes that frustration is a more likely reason . He next spent around six weeks in Qinzhou ( now Tianshui , Gansu province ) , where he wrote more than sixty poems . \\n',\n"," ' = = = Chengdu = = = \\n',\n"," ' In December 759 , he briefly stayed in Tonggu ( modern Gansu ) . He departed on December 24 for Chengdu ( Sichuan province ) , where he was hosted by local Prefect and fellow poet Pei Di . Du subsequently based himself in Sichuan for most of the next five years . By the autumn of that year he was in financial trouble , and sent poems begging help to various acquaintances . He was relieved by Yan Wu , a friend and former colleague who was appointed governor general at Chengdu . Despite his financial problems , this was one of the happiest and most peaceful periods of his life . Many of Du \\'s poems from this period are peaceful depictions of his life at \" thatched hut \" . In 762 , he left the city to escape a rebellion , but he returned in summer 764 when he was appointed an advisor to Yan , who was involved in campaigns against the Tibetan Empire . \\n',\n"," ' = = = Last years = = = \\n',\n"," \" Luoyang , the region of his birthplace , was recovered by government forces in the winter of 762 , and in the spring of 765 Du Fu and his family sailed down the Yangtze , apparently with the intention of making their way there . They traveled slowly , held up by his ill @-@ health ( by this time he was suffering from poor eyesight , deafness and general old age in addition to his previous ailments ) . They stayed in Kuizhou ( in what is now Baidicheng , Chongqing ) at the entrance to the Three Gorges for almost two years from late spring 766 . This period was Du Fu 's last great poetic flowering , and here he wrote 400 poems in his dense , late style . In autumn 766 , Bo Maolin became governor of the region : he supported Du Fu financially and employed him as his unofficial secretary . \\n\",\n"," ' In March 768 , he began his journey again and got as far as Hunan province , where he died in Tanzhou ( now Changsha ) in November or December 770 , in his 58th year . He was survived by his wife and two sons , who remained in the area for some years at least . His last known descendant is a grandson who requested a grave inscription for the poet from Yuan Zhen in 813 . \\n',\n"," ' Hung summarises his life by concluding that , \" He appeared to be a filial son , an affectionate father , a generous brother , a faithful husband , a loyal friend , a dutiful official , and a patriotic subject . \" \\n',\n"," \" Below is an example of one of Du Fu 's later works , To My Retired Friend Wei ( Chinese : 贈衛八處士 ) . Like many other poems in the Tang it featured the theme of a long parting between friends , which was often due to officials being frequently transferred to the provinces : \\n\",\n"," ' = = Works = = \\n',\n"," \" Criticism of Du Fu 's works has focused on his strong sense of history , his moral engagement , and his technical excellence . \\n\",\n"," ' = = = History = = = \\n',\n"," ' Since the Song dynasty , critics have called Du Fu the \" poet historian \" ( 詩史 shī shǐ ) . The most directly historical of his poems are those commenting on military tactics or the successes and failures of the government , or the poems of advice which he wrote to the emperor . Indirectly , he wrote about the effect of the times in which he lived on himself , and on the ordinary people of China . As Watson notes , this is information \" of a kind seldom found in the officially compiled histories of the era \" . \\n',\n"," ' Du Fu \\'s political comments are based on emotion rather than calculation : his prescriptions have been paraphrased as , \" Let us all be less selfish , let us all do what we are supposed to do \" . Since his views were impossible to disagree with , his forcefully expressed truisms enabled his installation as the central figure of Chinese poetic history . \\n',\n"," ' = = = Moral engagement = = = \\n',\n"," ' A second favourite epithet of Chinese critics is that of \" poet sage \" ( 詩聖 shī shèng ) , a counterpart to the philosophical sage , Confucius . One of the earliest surviving works , The Song of the Wagons ( from around 750 ) , gives voice to the sufferings of a conscript soldier in the imperial army and a clear @-@ sighted consciousness of suffering . These concerns are continuously articulated in poems on the lives of both soldiers and civilians produced by Du Fu throughout his life . \\n',\n"," ' Although Du Fu \\'s frequent references to his own difficulties can give the impression of an all @-@ consuming solipsism , Hawkes argues that his \" famous compassion in fact includes himself , viewed quite objectively and almost as an afterthought \" . He therefore \" lends grandeur \" to the wider picture by comparing it to \" his own slightly comical triviality \" . \\n',\n"," ' Du Fu \\'s compassion , for himself and for others , was part of his general broadening of the scope of poetry : he devoted many works to topics which had previously been considered unsuitable for poetic treatment . Zhang Jie wrote that for Du Fu , \" everything in this world is poetry \" , Du wrote extensively on subjects such as domestic life , calligraphy , paintings , animals , and other poems . \\n',\n"," ' = = = Technical excellence = = = \\n',\n"," ' Du Fu \\'s work is notable above all for its range . Chinese critics traditionally used the term 集大成 ( jídàchéng- \" complete symphony \" ) , a reference to Mencius \\' description of Confucius . Yuan Zhen was the first to note the breadth of Du Fu \\'s achievement , writing in 813 that his predecessor , \" united in his work traits which previous men had displayed only singly \" . He mastered all the forms of Chinese poetry : Chou says that in every form he \" either made outstanding advances or contributed outstanding examples \" . Furthermore , his poems use a wide range of registers , from the direct and colloquial to the allusive and self @-@ consciously literary . This variety is manifested even within individual works : Owen identifies the , \" rapid stylistic and thematic shifts \" in poems which enable the poet to represent different facets of a situation , while Chou uses the term \" juxtaposition \" as the major analytical tool in her work . Du Fu is noted for having written more on poetics and painting than any other writer of his time . He wrote eighteen poems on painting alone , more than any other Tang poet . Du Fu \\'s seemingly negative commentary on the prized horse paintings of Han Gan ignited a controversy that has persisted to the present day . \\n',\n"," ' The tenor of his work changed as he developed his style and adapted to his surroundings ( \" chameleon @-@ like \" according to Watson ) : his earliest works are in a relatively derivative , courtly style , but he came into his own in the years of the rebellion . Owen comments on the \" grim simplicity \" of the Qinzhou poems , which mirrors the desert landscape ; the works from his Chengdu period are \" light , often finely observed \" ; while the poems from the late Kuizhou period have a \" density and power of vision \" . \\n',\n"," ' Although he wrote in all poetic forms , Du Fu is best known for his lǜshi , a type of poem with strict constraints on form and content , for example : \\n',\n"," ' About two thirds of Du Fu \\'s 1500 extant works are in this form , and he is generally considered to be its leading exponent . His best lǜshi use the parallelisms required by the form to add expressive content rather than as mere technical restrictions . Hawkes comments that , \" it is amazing that Tu Fu is able to use so immensely stylized a form in so natural a manner \" . \\n',\n"," ' = = Influence = = \\n',\n"," ' According to the Encyclopædia Britannica , Du Fu \\'s writings are considered by many literary critics to be among the greatest of all time , and it states \" his dense , compressed language makes use of all the connotative overtones of a phrase and of all the intonational potentials of the individual word , qualities that no translation can ever reveal . \" \\n',\n"," ' In his lifetime and immediately following his death , Du Fu was not greatly appreciated . In part this can be attributed to his stylistic and formal innovations , some of which are still \" considered extremely daring and bizarre by Chinese critics . \" There are few contemporary references to him — only eleven poems from six writers — and these describe him in terms of affection , but not as a paragon of poetic or moral ideals . Du Fu is also poorly represented in contemporary anthologies of poetry . \\n',\n"," ' However , as Hung notes , he \" is the only Chinese poet whose influence grew with time \" , and his works began to increase in popularity in the ninth century . Early positive comments came from Bai Juyi , who praised the moral sentiments of some of Du Fu \\'s works ( although he found these in only a small fraction of the poems ) , and from Han Yu , who wrote a piece defending Du Fu and Li Bai on aesthetic grounds from attacks made against them . Both these writers showed the influence of Du Fu in their own poetic work . By the beginning of the 10th century , Wei Zhuang constructed the first replica of his thatched cottage in Sichuan . \\n',\n"," ' It was in the 11th century , during the Northern Song era that Du Fu \\'s reputation reached its peak . In this period a comprehensive re @-@ evaluation of earlier poets took place , in which Wang Wei , Li Bai and Du Fu came to be regarded as representing respectively the Buddhist , Daoist and Confucian strands of Chinese culture . At the same time , the development of Neo @-@ Confucianism ensured that Du Fu , as its poetic exemplar , occupied the paramount position . Su Shi famously expressed this reasoning when he wrote that Du Fu was \" preeminent ... because ... through all his vicissitudes , he never for the space of a meal forgot his sovereign \" . His influence was helped by his ability to reconcile apparent opposites : political conservatives were attracted by his loyalty to the established order , while political radicals embraced his concern for the poor . Literary conservatives could look to his technical mastery , while literary radicals were inspired by his innovations . Since the establishment of the People \\'s Republic of China , Du Fu \\'s loyalty to the state and concern for the poor have been interpreted as embryonic nationalism and socialism , and he has been praised for his use of simple , \" people \\'s language \" . \\n',\n"," ' Du Fu \\'s popularity grew to such an extent that it is as hard to measure his influence as that of Shakespeare in England : it was hard for any Chinese poet not to be influenced by him . While there was never another Du Fu , individual poets followed in the traditions of specific aspects of his work : Bai Juyi \\'s concern for the poor , Lu You \\'s patriotism , and Mei Yaochen \\'s reflections on the quotidian are a few examples . More broadly , Du Fu \\'s work in transforming the lǜshi from mere word play into \" a vehicle for serious poetic utterance \" set the stage for every subsequent writer in the genre . \\n',\n"," ' In the 20th century , he was the favourite poet of Kenneth Rexroth , who has described him as \" the greatest non @-@ epic , non @-@ dramatic poet who has survived in any language \" , and commented that , \" he has made me a better man , as a moral agent and as a perceiving organism \" . \\n',\n"," ' = = = Influence on Japanese literature = = = \\n',\n"," \" Du Fu 's poetry has made a profound impact on Japanese literature , especially on the literature from the Muromachi period and on scholars and poets in the Edo period , including Matsuo Bashō , the very greatest of all haiku poets . Even in modern Japanese , the term Saint of Poetry ( 詩聖 , shisei ) is mostly synonymous with Du Fu . \\n\",\n"," ' Until the 13th century , the Japanese preferred Bai Juyi above all poets and there were few references to Du Fu , although his influence can be seen in some kanshi ( \" Chinese poetry made by Japanese poets \" ) anthologies such as Bunka Shūreishū in the 9th century . The first notable Japanese appreciator of Du Fu \\'s poetry was Kokan Shiren ( 1278 – 1346 ) , a Rinzai Zen patriarch and one of the most prominent authors of the literature of the Five Mountains ; he highly praised Du Fu and made a commentary on some poems of Du Fu from the perspective of a Zen priest in Vol . 11 of Saihokushū . His student Chūgan Engetsu composed many kanshi which were clearly stated \" influenced by Du Fu \" in their prefaces . Chūgan \\'s student Gidō Shūshin had close connection with the Court and Ashikaga Shogunate and propagated Du Fu \\'s poetry in the mundane world ; one day Nijō Yoshimoto , the Kampaku regent of the Court and the highest authority of renga poetry , asked Gidō , \" Should I learn the poetry of Du Fu and Li Bai ? \" Gidō dared to reply , \" Yes if you do have enough capability . No if do not . \" Since then , there had been many seminars on Du Fu \\'s poetry both in Zen temples and in the aristocratic society , and as a result his poetry was often cited in Japanese literature in the Muromachi period , e.g. , Taiheiki , a historical epic in the late 14th century , and some noh plays such as Hyakuman , Bashō , and Shunkan . \\n',\n"," \" During the Kan 'ei era of the Edo period ( 1624 – 1643 ) , Shào Chuán ( 邵傳 ) of the Ming Dynasty 's Collective Commentary on Du Fu 's Lǜshi ( 杜律集解 , Toritsu Shikkai ) was imported into Japan , and it gained explosive popularity in Confucian scholars and chōnin ( townspeople ) class . The commentary established Du Fu 's fame as the highest of all poets ; for instance , Hayashi Shunsai , a notable Confucian scholar , commented in Vol . 37 of Gahō Bunshū that Zǐměi [ Du Fu ] was the very best poet in history and praised Shào Chuán 's commentary for its simplicity and readability , while he criticized old commentaries during the Yuan Dynasty were too unfathomable . Matsuo Bashō , the greatest haiku poet , was also strongly influenced by Du Fu ; in Oku no Hosomichi , his masterpiece , he cites the first two lines of A Spring View ( 春望 ) before a haiku as its introduction and also many of his other haiku have similar wording and themes . It is said that when he died in Osaka during a long travel , a copy of Du Fu 's poetry was found with him as one of a few precious items which he was able to carry around . \\n\",\n"," ' = = Translation = = \\n',\n"," ' A variety of styles have been used in efforts to translate Du Fu \\'s work into English . As Burton Watson remarks in The Selected Poems of Du Fu , \" There are many different ways to approach the problems involved in translating Du Fu , which is why we need as many different translations as possible \" ( p. xxii ) . The translators have had to contend with bringing out the formal constraints of the original without sounding laboured to a Western ear ( particularly when translating regulated verse , or lǜshi ) , and accommodating the complex allusions contained particularly in the later works ( Hawkes writes that \" his poems do not as a rule come through very well in translation \" — p. ix ) . One extreme on each issue is represented by Kenneth Rexroth \\'s One Hundred Poems From the Chinese . His are free translations , which seek to conceal the parallelisms through enjambement and expansion and contraction of the content ; his responses to the allusions are firstly to omit most of these poems from his selection , and secondly to \" translate out \" the references in those works which he does select . \\n',\n"," ' Other translators have placed much greater weight on trying to convey a sense of the poetic forms used by Du Fu . Vikram Seth in Three Chinese Poets uses English @-@ style rhyme schemes , whereas Keith Holyoak in Facing the Moon approximates the Chinese rhyme scheme ; both use end @-@ stopped lines and preserve some degree of parallelism . In The Selected Poems of Du Fu , Burton Watson follows the parallelisms quite strictly , persuading the western reader to adapt to the poems rather than vice versa .

Originally intended to be repeats of the preceding Fusō class , they were redesigned before construction began . Both ships carried supplies for the survivors of the Great Kantō earthquake in 1923 . They were modernized in 1934 – 37 with improvements to their armour and machinery and a rebuilt superstructure in the pagoda mast style . Afterwards they played a minor role in the Second Sino @-@ Japanese War . \\n',\n"," \" Despite the expensive reconstructions , both vessels were considered obsolete by the eve of the Pacific War , and neither saw significant action in the early years of the war . Following the loss of most of the IJN 's large aircraft carriers during the Battle of Midway in mid @-@ 1942 , they were rebuilt with a flight deck replacing the rear pair of gun turrets to give them the ability to operate an air group of floatplanes . A lack of aircraft and qualified pilots , however , meant that they never actually operated their aircraft in combat . While awaiting their air group the sister ships were sometimes used to ferry troops and material to Japanese bases . They participated in the Battle of Cape Engaño in late 1944 , where they decoyed the American carrier fleet supporting the invasion of Leyte away from the landing beaches . Afterwards both ships were transferred to Southeast Asia ; in early 1945 they participated in Operation Kita , where they transported petrol and other strategic materials to Japan . The sisters were then reduced to reserve until they were sunk during American airstrikes in July . After the war they were scrapped in 1946 – 47 . \\n\",\n"," ' = = Background = = \\n',\n"," \" The design of the Fusō @-@ class battleships was shaped both by the ongoing international naval arms race and a desire among Japanese naval planners to maintain a fleet of capital ships powerful enough to defeat the United States Navy in an encounter in Japanese territorial waters . The IJN 's fleet of battleships had proven highly successful in 1905 , the last year of the Russo @-@ Japanese War , which culminated in the destruction of the Russian Second and Third Pacific Squadrons at the Battle of Tsushima . \\n\",\n"," ' In the aftermath , the Japanese Empire immediately turned its focus to the two remaining rivals for imperial dominance in the Pacific Ocean : Britain and the United States . Satō Tetsutarō , a Japanese Navy admiral and military theorist , speculated that conflict would inevitably arise between Japan and at least one of its two main rivals . To that end , he called for the Japanese Navy to maintain a fleet with at least 70 % as many capital ships as the US Navy . This ratio , Satō theorized , would enable the Imperial Japanese Navy to defeat the US Navy in one major battle in Japanese waters in any eventual conflict . Accordingly , the 1907 Imperial Defence Policy called for the construction of a battle fleet of eight modern battleships , 20 @,@ 000 long tons ( 20 @,@ 321 t ) each , and eight modern armoured cruisers , 18 @,@ 000 long tons ( 18 @,@ 289 t ) each . This was the genesis of the Eight @-@ Eight Fleet Program , the development of a cohesive battle line of sixteen capital ships . \\n',\n"," \" The launch of HMS Dreadnought in 1906 by the Royal Navy raised the stakes , and complicated Japan 's plans . Displacing 17 @,@ 900 long tons ( 18 @,@ 200 t ) and armed with ten 12 @-@ inch ( 30 @.@ 5 cm ) guns , Dreadnought rendered all existing battleships obsolete by comparison . The launch of the battlecruiser HMS Invincible the following year was a further setback for Japan 's quest for parity . When the two new Satsuma @-@ class battleships and two Tsukuba @-@ class armoured cruisers , launched by 1911 , were outclassed by their British counterparts , the Eight @-@ Eight Fleet Program was restarted . \\n\",\n"," ' The first battleships built for the renewed Eight @-@ Eight Fleet Program were the two dreadnoughts of the Kawachi class , ordered in 1907 and laid down in 1908 . In 1910 , the Navy put forward a request to the Diet ( parliament ) to secure funding for the entirety of the program at once . Because of economic constraints , only four battlecruisers and a single battleship of the Fusō class were ultimately approved by the Diet . Three more Fusō @-@ class ships ( Yamashiro , Ise , and Hyūga ) were approved and all three were ordered in April 1913 . While Yamashiro was laid down later that year , the IJN lacked the funding to proceed with the construction of Ise and Hyūga until the Diet authorized additional funding for the ships in July 1914 . \\n',\n"," ' = = Design and description = = \\n',\n"," \" The progress of Fusō 's construction , while the IJN waited for the funding to be released and foreign developments , caused the IJN to reassess the Fusō @-@ class design . The distribution of the midships gun turrets was the most obvious flaw as they complicated the protection of the midships magazine and exposed more of the ship to the blast effects of the guns when they fired . Another issue was that Japanese sailors had problems maintaining a high rate of fire with the 45 @.@ 36 @-@ kilogram ( 100 @.@ 0 lb ) shells used in the manually loaded 152 @-@ millimetre ( 6 in ) secondary guns used in the Fusō class and earlier designs . To resolve this issue , the IJN designed a smaller 140 @-@ millimetre ( 5 @.@ 5 in ) gun that offset its lighter shell weight with a higher rate of fire . It also decided that the barbette armour of the earlier ships was too thin and wanted a modest increase in speed to partially counter the higher speeds of the latest foreign ships like the British Queen Elizabeth @-@ class battleships and Russian Borodino @-@ class battlecruisers . For financial reasons more powerful engines could not be ordered so the new design was lengthened slightly and the boiler rooms enlarged to increase speed by 0 @.@ 5 knots ( 0 @.@ 93 km / h ; 0 @.@ 58 mph ) to 23 knots ( 43 km / h ; 26 mph ) . To save weight the forecastle deck was shortened so that the lower midships gun turret was lower than in the Fusō class . This reduced the crew 's accommodations despite a significant increase in the crew 's numbers and naval historian Fukui Shizuo believed that these ships had the worst habitability of any Japanese capital ship . The final design was designated A @-@ 92 by the IJN and differed enough from the A @-@ 64 design of the Fusō class that it was considered a separate class . \\n\",\n"," ' The ships had a length of 208 @.@ 18 metres ( 683 ft 0 in ) overall , a beam of 28 @.@ 65 metres ( 94 ft 0 in ) and a draught of 8 @.@ 93 metres ( 29 ft 4 in ) at deep load .

The other carrier air groups were not in much better shape and the Japanese decided to retain the aircraft ashore for use against the American carriers . The Fourth Carrier Division was assigned to the Northern Force under the command of Vice Admiral Jisaburō Ozawa and the sisters sailed from Yashima on 20 October . On the morning of 24 October , the bulk of the few aircraft aboard were launched to attack the American carriers as a distraction . They inflicted no damage and caused the Americans to search in the direction from which they had attacked . The Americans finally spotted the Japanese carriers at 16 : 40 , some 200 miles ( 320 km ) east of Cape Engaño , the northeastern tip of Luzon . The American carriers were spread out and it was very late in the day to launch an airstrike , so Admiral William Halsey , commander of the Third Fleet decided to mass his carriers in a position to attack the following morning . Ozawa reversed course during the night , correctly believing that the Americans would follow him north . \\n',\n"," \" Although they had lost contact during the night , the Americans did find the Japanese carriers at 07 : 35 .

This was just the first of a total of five airstrikes that the Americans launched that day . The sisters were not heavily engaged by the early airstrikes which are focusing on the group 's aircraft carriers . Ise claimed to have shot down five attacking dive bombers from the second wave and one small bomb detonated on Turret No. 2 . Hyūga was lightly damaged by near misses that rupture some hull plating in her bulge and pepper her superstructure with splinters .

While an exact total of her casualties is not available , it has been estimated that 5 men were killed and some 111 – 121 crewmen were wounded during this attack . Hyūga was unsuccessfully attacked by an American submarine at 18 : 43 . Around 19 : 00 Ozawa learned about a force of destroyers and cruisers that drove off the Japanese destroyers rescuing survivors from some of the carriers lost earlier in the day and sank Chiyoda . He ordered the Fourth Carrier Division to reverse course and engage the Americans , but the battleships were unable to find them , and Ozawa ordered them to reverse course and head for Amami Ōshima . When they arrived on 27 October , Ozawa transferred to Hyūga and hoisted his flag aboard her .

The division sailed for Singapore on 30 December and Vice Admiral Kiyohide Shima transferred his flag to the light cruiser Ōyodo on arrival there the following day . The division continued onwards to Lingga . Its planned return to Japan was delayed by attacks by the American Third Fleet on targets in Indochina and southern China that sank two oil tankers that were intended to refuel the division . \\n',\n"," ' The IJN then decided to use the sisters and their escorts to bring a load of petrol , rubber , tin and other strategic minerals back to Japan after the American carriers departed the South China Sea ( Operation Kita ) .

Decrypted Japanese radio signals revealed the Japanese plan to the Allies , and 15 submarines were positioned along their anticipated route in an attempt to intercept and sink the ships . An additional 11 were moved into position while the group was en route , but only three were ultimately able to attack . None of them were successful before the Japanese reached Kure on 20 February . The Fourth Carrier Division was disbanded on 1 March and the sisters were reduced to 1st rank reserve ships . On 19 March Kure was attacked by aircraft from Task Force 58 and Hyūga was hit three times by bombs that killed 37 men and wounded 52 .

The bombs started numerous leaks and Ise began to settle by the bow , although she was returned to an even keel after three @-@ days pumping .

At the time , the radius of maximum winds was 15 mi ( 24 km ) , which was smaller than average . After landfall , the hurricane weakened rapidly while crossing the state . It briefly emerged into the Gulf of Mexico as a tropical storm early on September 5 . A few hours later while continuing to the northwest , it made another landfall near Rosewood — a ghost town in Levy County , east of Cedar Key — with winds of about 65 mph ( 105 km / h ) .

At Olympia , an abandoned settlement also known as Olympia Beach , strong winds leveled the old Olympia Inn , a gas station , and the second floor of a pharmaceutical building . Winds also tore the roof off an ice plant . A bridge leading to the barrier island from Olympia was partly wrecked ; the bridge tender survived by gripping the railing during the storm . Winds leveled his nearby home . According to the Monthly Weather Review , some of the most severe damage from the storm in Florida was at Olympia . The storm left many homes in Hobe Sound uninhabitable , forcing crews to tear them down . Winter estates on the island , however , were better built and little damaged . While Stuart and Hobe Sound sustained significant damage , Port Salerno suffered minimally . In Stuart , the storm left 400 to 500 people homeless , up to nearly 10 % of the population , which was 5 @,@ 100 at the time .

It was a part of the Battle of Pusan Perimeter , and was one of several large engagements fought simultaneously . The battle ended in a victory for the United Nations after large numbers of United States ( US ) and Republic of Korea ( ROK ) troops repelled a strong North Korean attack . \\n',\n"," \" After the First Battle of Naktong Bulge , the US Army 's 2nd Infantry Division was moved to defend the Naktong River line . The division , which was untried in combat , was struck with a strong attack by several divisions of the Korean People 's Army which crossed the river and struck all along the division 's line . The force of the attack split the US 2nd Infantry Division in half , and the North Koreans were able to penetrate to Yongsan , promoting a fight there . \\n\",\n"," ' The urgency of the threat to Pusan Perimeter prompted the US Marine Corps 1st Provisional Marine Brigade to be brought in to reinforce the US Army troops . In two weeks of heavy fighting , the US forces were able to force the North Koreans out of the Naktong Bulge region . The North Koreans were further repulsed after the UN counterattack at Inchon , which culminated in the virtual destruction of the North Korean army . \\n',\n"," ' = = Background = = \\n',\n"," ' = = = Pusan Perimeter = = = \\n',\n"," \" From the outbreak of the Korean War and the invasion of South Korea by the North , the North Korean People 's Army had enjoyed superiority in both manpower and equipment over both the Republic of Korea Army and the United Nations forces dispatched to South Korea to prevent it from collapsing . The North Korean strategy was to aggressively pursue UN and ROK forces on all avenues of approach south and to engage them aggressively , attacking from the front and initiating a double envelopment of both flanks of the unit , which allowed the North Koreans to surround and cut off the opposing force , which would then be forced to retreat in disarray , often leaving behind much of its equipment . From their initial June 25 offensive to fights in July and early August , the North Koreans used this strategy to effectively defeat any UN force and push it south . However , when the UN forces , under the Eighth United States Army , established the Pusan Perimeter in August , the UN troops held a continuous line along the peninsula which North Korean troops could not flank , and their advantages in numbers decreased daily as the superior UN logistical system brought in more troops and supplies to the UN army . \\n\",\n"," \" When the North Koreans approached the Pusan Perimeter on August 5 , they attempted the same frontal assault technique on the four main avenues of approach into the perimeter . Throughout August , the NK 6th Division , and later the NK 7th Division engaged the US 25th Infantry Division at the Battle of Masan , initially repelling a UN counteroffensive before countering with battles at Komam @-@ ni and Battle Mountain . These attacks stalled as UN forces , well equipped and with plenty of reserves , repeatedly repelled North Korean attacks . North of Masan , the NK 4th Division and the US 24th Infantry Division sparred in the Naktong Bulge area . In the First Battle of Naktong Bulge , the North Korean division was unable to hold its bridgehead across the river as large numbers of US reserve forces were brought in to repel it , and on August 19 , the NK 4th Division was forced back across the river with 50 percent casualties . In the Taegu region , five North Korean divisions were repulsed by three UN divisions in several attempts to attack the city during the Battle of Taegu . Particularly heavy fighting took place at the Battle of the Bowling Alley where the NK 13th Division was almost completely destroyed in the attack . On the east coast , three more North Korean divisions were repulsed by the South Koreans at P 'ohang @-@ dong during the Battle of P 'ohang @-@ dong . All along the front , the North Korean troops were reeling from these defeats , the first time in the war their strategies were not working . \\n\",\n"," ' = = = September push = = = \\n',\n"," ' In planning its new offensive , the North Korean command decided any attempt to flank the UN force was impossible thanks to the support of the UN navy . Instead , they opted to use frontal attack to breach the perimeter and collapse it as the only hope of achieving success in the battle . Fed by intelligence from the Soviet Union the North Koreans were aware the UN forces were building up along the Pusan Perimeter and that it must conduct an offensive soon or it could not win the battle . A secondary objective was to surround Taegu and destroy the UN and ROK units in that city . As part of this mission , the North Korean units would first cut the supply lines to Taegu . \\n',\n"," ' On August 20 , the North Korean commands distributed operations orders to their subordinate units . The North Koreans called for a simultaneous five @-@ prong attack against the UN lines .

However , the North Koreans weren 't aware that the US 2nd Infantry Division had recently replaced the US 24th Infantry Division in positions along the Naktong River . Consequently , they expected lighter resistance ; the 24th troops were exhausted from months of fighting but the 2nd Division men were fresh and newly arrived in Korea .

The US 2nd Division released E Company to the regiment and the next day it joined F Company to build up what became the main defensive position of the 23d Regiment in front of Changnyong . North Korean troops during the night passed around the right flank of 1st Battalion 's northern blocking position and reached the road three miles behind him near the division artillery positions .

Keiser decided that this situation made it advisable to control and direct the divided division as two special forces . Accordingly , he placed the division artillery commander , Brigadier General Loyal M. Haynes , in command of the northern group . Haynes ' command post was 7 miles ( 11 km ) north of Changnyong . Task Force Haynes became operational at 10 : 20 , September 1 . Southward , in the Yongsan area , Keiser placed Brigadier General Joseph S.

The NK 9th Division had effected major crossings of the Naktong at two principal points against the US 9th Infantry ; the NK 2nd Division in the meantime had made three major crossings against the US 23rd Infantry ; and the NK 10th Division had begun crossing more troops in the Hill 409 area near Hyongp 'ung in the US 38th Infantry sector .

From there at daylight the men could see North Korean soldiers on many of the ridges surrounding them , most of them moving east .

The North Koreans broke from the houses , running for the river . At this the light machine gun at the tip of the ridge took them under fire , as did another across the Naktong to the south in the US 25th Infantry Division sector . Proximity fuze artillery fire decimated this group . Combined fire from all weapons inflicted an estimated 300 casualties on this North Korean force . In the afternoon , US aircraft dropped food and ammunition to the company ; only part of it was recovered .

Badly wounded , Story refused to be a burden to those who might escape , and when last seen was still engaging North Korean at close range . Of those in the company , approximately ten men escaped to friendly lines . The next morning , under heavy fog , the group made its way by compass toward Yongsan . From a hill at 12 : 00 , after the fog had lifted , the men looked down on the Battle of Yongsan which was then in progress .

The North Koreans quickly discovered Task Force Manchu group . They first attacked it at 14 : 00 that afternoon , and were repulsed . That night an estimated company attacked three times , pressing the fight to close quarters , but failed each time to penetrate the tight US perimeter . Daylight of the second day disclosed many North Korean dead on the steep slopes outside the perimeter . \\n',\n"," ' In the afternoon of September 2 Schmitt radioed 1st Battalion for an airdrop of supplies .

Soon , mortars emplaced on a neighboring high finger ridge eastward registered on Schmitt \\'s perimeter and continued firing until dark . The machine gun fire forced every man to stay in his foxhole . The lifting of the mortar fire after dark was the signal for renewed North Korean infantry attacks , all of which were repulsed . But the number of killed and wounded within the perimeter was growing , and supplies were diminishing . There were no medical supplies except those carried by one aid man . \\n',\n"," ' The third day , September 3 , the situation worsened . The weather was hot and ammunition , food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted . Since the previous afternoon , North Korean mortar barrages had alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter . Survivors later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed . Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself . Dead and dying US troops were in almost every foxhole . Mortar fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units . Artillery fire and air strikes requested by Schmitt never came . Some North Koreans worked their way close to the perimeter and threw grenades into it . Six times Ouellette leaped from his foxhole to escape grenades thrown into it . In this close action Ouellette was killed . Most of the foxholes of the perimeter received one or more direct mortar hits in the course of the continuing mortar fire . One of these killed Schmitt on September 3 .

When it got dark the survivors would split into small groups and try to get back to friendly lines . That evening after dark the North Koreans launched another weak attack against the position . At 22 : 00 , McDoniel and Caldwell and 27 enlisted men slipped off the hill in groups of four . Master Sergeant Travis E. Watkins , still alive in his paralyzed condition , refused efforts of evacuation , saying that he did not want to be a burden to those who had a chance to get away . He asked only that his carbine be loaded and placed on his chest with the muzzle under his chin . Like Oullette , he would also win the Medal of Honor for his actions .

The ironclad was developed as a result of the vulnerability of wooden warships to explosive or incendiary shells . The first ironclad battleship , Gloire , was launched by the French Navy in November 1859 . The British Admiralty had been considering armored warships since 1856 and prepared a draft design for an armored corvette in 1857 ; in early 1859 the Royal Navy started building two iron @-@ hulled armored frigates , and by 1861 had made the decision to move to an all @-@ armored battle fleet . After the first clashes of ironclads ( both with wooden ships and with one another ) took place in 1862 during the American Civil War , it became clear that the ironclad had replaced the unarmored ship of the line as the most powerful warship afloat . This type of ship would come to be very successful in the American Civil War . \\n',\n"," ' Ironclads were designed for several roles , including as high seas battleships , coastal defense ships , and long @-@ range cruisers . The rapid evolution of warship design in the late 19th century transformed the ironclad from a wooden @-@ hulled vessel that carried sails to supplement its steam engines into the steel @-@ built , turreted battleships and cruisers familiar in the 20th century . This change was pushed forward by the development of heavier naval guns ( the ironclads of the 1880s carried some of the heaviest guns ever mounted at sea ) , more sophisticated steam engines , and advances in metallurgy which made steel shipbuilding possible . \\n',\n"," ' The quick pace of change meant that many ships were obsolete as soon as they were finished , and that naval tactics were in a state of flux . Many ironclads were built to make use of the ram or the torpedo , which a number of naval designers considered the important weapons of naval combat . There is no clear end to the ironclad period , but towards the end of the 1890s the term ironclad dropped out of use . New ships were increasingly constructed to a standard pattern and designated battleships or armored cruisers . \\n',\n"," ' = = The ironclad = = \\n',\n"," ' The ironclad became technically feasible and tactically necessary because of developments in shipbuilding in the first half of the 19th century . According to naval historian J. Richard Hill : \" The ( ironclad ) had three chief characteristics : a metal @-@ skinned hull , steam propulsion and a main armament of guns capable of firing explosive shells . It is only when all three characteristics are present that a fighting ship can properly be called an ironclad . \" Each of these developments was introduced separately in the decade before the first ironclads . \\n',\n"," ' = = = Steam propulsion = = = \\n',\n"," ' In the 18th and early 19th centuries fleets had relied on two types of major warship , the ship of the line and the frigate . The first major change to these types was the introduction of steam power for propulsion . While paddle steamer warships had been used from the 1830s onwards , steam propulsion only became suitable for major warships after the adoption of the screw propeller in the 1840s . \\n',\n"," ' Steam @-@ powered screw frigates were built in the mid @-@ 1840s , and at the end of the decade the French Navy introduced steam power to its line of battle . The desire for change came from the ambition of Napoleon III to gain greater influence in Europe , which required a challenge to the British at sea . The first purpose @-@ built steam battleship was the 90 @-@ gun Napoléon in 1850 . Napoléon was armed as a conventional ship @-@ of @-@ the @-@ line , but her steam engines could give her a speed of 12 knots ( 22 km / h ) , regardless of the wind conditions : a potentially decisive advantage in a naval engagement . \\n',\n"," ' The introduction of the steam ship @-@ of @-@ the @-@ line led to a building competition between France and Britain . Eight sister ships to Napoléon were built in France over a period of ten years , but the United Kingdom soon managed to take the lead in production . Altogether , France built ten new wooden steam battleships and converted 28 from older ships of the line , while the United Kingdom built 18 and converted 41 . \\n',\n"," ' = = = Explosive shells = = = \\n',\n"," ' The era of the wooden steam ship @-@ of @-@ the @-@ line was brief , because of new , more powerful naval guns . In the 1820s and 1830s , warships began to mount increasingly heavy guns , replacing 18- and 24 @-@ pounder guns with 32 @-@ pounders on sailing ships @-@ of @-@ the @-@ line and introducing 68 @-@ pounders on steamers . Then , the first shell guns firing explosive shells were introduced following their development by the French Général Henri @-@ Joseph Paixhans , and by the 1840s were part of the standard armament for naval powers including the French Navy , Royal Navy , Imperial Russian Navy and United States Navy . It is often held that the power of explosive shells to smash wooden hulls , as demonstrated by the Russian destruction of an Ottoman squadron at the Battle of Sinop , spelled the end of the wooden @-@ hulled warship . The more practical threat to wooden ships was from conventional cannon firing red @-@ hot shot , which could lodge in the hull of a wooden ship and cause a fire or ammunition explosion . Some navies even experimented with hollow shot filled with molten metal for extra incendiary power . \\n',\n"," ' = = = Iron armor = = = \\n',\n"," ' The use of iron instead of wood as the primary material of ships \\' hulls began in the 1830s ; the first \" warship \" with an iron hull was the gunboat Nemesis , built by Laird for the East India Company in 1839 . There followed , also from Laird , the first full @-@ blown warships with metal hulls , the 1842 steam frigates Guadelupe and Montezuma for the Mexican navy . But a thin iron skin , while not being susceptible to fire or lethal splintering like wood , was not the same thing as providing iron armor calculated to stop enemy gunfire . \\n',\n"," ' Following the demonstration of the power of explosive shells against wooden ships at the Battle of Sinop , and fearing that his own ships would be vulnerable to the Paixhans guns of Russian fortifications in the Crimean War , Emperor Napoleon III ordered the development of light @-@ draft floating batteries , equipped with heavy guns and protected by heavy armor . Experiments made during the first half of 1854 proved highly satisfactory , and on 17 July 1854 , the French communicated to the British Government that a solution had been found to make gun @-@ proof vessels and that plans would be communicated . After tests in September 1854 , the British Admiralty agreed to build five armoured floating batteries on the French plans , establishing the important Thames and Millwall Iron Works within the docks . \\n',\n"," ' The French floating batteries were deployed in 1855 as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the Crimean War . The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications . The French used three of their ironclad batteries ( Lave , Tonnante and Dévastation ) in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of Kinburn on the Black Sea , where they were effective against Russian shore defences . They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859 . The British floating batteries Glatton and Meteor arrived too late to participate to the action at Kinburn . The British planned to use theirs in the Baltic Sea against the well @-@ fortified naval base at Kronstadt . \\n',\n"," ' The batteries have a claim to the title of the first ironclad warships but they were capable of only 4 knots ( 7 km / h ) under their own power : they operated under their own power at the Battle of Kinburn , but had to be towed for long range transit . They were also arguably marginal to the work of the navy . The brief success of the floating ironclad batteries convinced France to begin work on armored warships for their battlefleet . \\n',\n"," ' = = Early ironclad ships and battles = = \\n',\n"," ' By the end of the 1850s it was clear that France was unable to match British building of steam warships , and to regain the strategic initiative a dramatic change was required . The result was the first ocean @-@ going ironclad , the Gloire , begun in 1857 and launched in 1859 . \\n',\n"," \" Gloire 's wooden hull was modelled on that of a steam ship of the line , reduced to one deck , sheathed in iron plates 4 @.@ 5 inches ( 110 mm ) thick . She was propelled by a steam engine , driving a single screw propeller for a speed of 13 knots ( 24 km / h ) . She was armed with thirty @-@ six 6 @.@ 4 @-@ inch ( 160 mm ) rifled guns . France proceeded to construct 16 ironclad warships , including two more sister ships to Gloire , and the only two @-@ decked broadside ironclads ever built , Magenta and Solférino . \\n\",\n"," \" The Royal Navy had not been keen to sacrifice its advantage in steam ships of the line , but was determined that the first British ironclad would outmatch the French ships in every respect , particularly speed . A fast ship would have the advantage of being able to choose a range of engagement which could make her invulnerable to enemy fire . The British specification was more a large , powerful frigate than a ship @-@ of @-@ the @-@ line . The requirement for speed meant a very long vessel , which had to be built from iron . The result was the construction of two Warrior @-@ class ironclads ; HMS Warrior and HMS Black Prince . The ships had a successful design , though there were necessarily compromises between ' sea @-@ keeping ' , strategic range and armour protection ; their weapons were more effective than that of Gloire , and with the largest set of steam engines yet fitted to a ship they could steam at 14 @.@ 3 knots ( 26 @.@ 5 km / h ) . Yet the Gloire and her sisters had full iron @-@ armour protection along the waterline and the battery itself . Warrior and Black Prince ( but also the smaller Defence and Resistance ) were obliged to concentrate their armour in a central ' citadel ' or ' armoured box ' , leaving many main deck guns and the fore and aft sections of the vessel unprotected . The use of iron in the construction of Warrior also came with some drawbacks ; iron hulls required more regular and intensive repairs than wooden hulls , and iron was more susceptible to fouling by marine life . \\n\",\n"," ' By 1862 , navies across Europe had adopted ironclads . Britain and France each had sixteen either completed or under construction , though the British vessels were larger . Austria , Italy , Russia , and Spain were also building ironclads . However , the first battles using the new ironclad ships involved neither Britain nor France , and involved ships markedly different from the broadside @-@ firing , masted designs of Gloire and Warrior . The use of ironclads by both sides in the American Civil War , and the clash of the Italian and Austrian fleets at the Battle of Lissa , had an important influence on the development of ironclad design . \\n',\n"," ' = = = First battles between ironclads : the U.S. Civil War = = = \\n',\n"," ' The first use of ironclads in action came in the U.S. Civil War . The U.S. Navy at the time the war broke out had no ironclads , its most powerful ships being six steam @-@ powered unarmoured frigates . Since the bulk of the Navy remained loyal to the Union , the Confederacy sought to gain advantage in the naval conflict by acquiring modern armored ships . In May 1861 , the Confederate Congress voted that $ 2 million be appropriated for the purchase of ironclads from overseas , and in July and August 1861 the Confederacy started work on construction and converting wooden ships . \\n',\n"," ' On 12 October 1861 , the CSS Manassas became the first ironclad to enter combat , when she fought Union warships on the Mississippi during the Battle of the Head of Passes . She had been converted from a commercial vessel in New Orleans for river and coastal fighting . In February 1862 , the larger CSS Virginia joined the Confederate Navy , having been rebuilt at Norfolk . Constructed on the hull of USS Merrimack , Virginia originally was a conventional warship made of wood , but she was converted into an iron @-@ covered casemate ironclad gunship , when she entered the Confederate navy . By this time , the Union had completed seven ironclad gunboats of the City class , and was about to complete the USS Monitor , an innovative design proposed by the Swedish inventor John Ericsson . The Union was also building a large armored frigate , the USS New Ironsides , and the smaller USS Galena . \\n',\n"," \" The first battle between ironclads happened on 9 March 1862 , as the armored Monitor was deployed to protect the Union 's wooden fleet from the ironclad ram Virginia and other Confederate warships . In this engagement , the second day of the Battle of Hampton Roads , the two ironclads repeatedly tried to ram one another while shells bounced off their armor . The battle attracted attention worldwide , making it clear that the wooden warship was now out of date , with the ironclads destroying them easily . \\n\",\n"," ' The Civil War saw more ironclads built by both sides , and they played an increasing role in the naval war alongside the unarmored warships , commerce raiders and blockade runners . The Union built a large fleet of fifty monitors modeled on their namesake . The Confederacy built ships designed as smaller versions of the Virginia , many of which saw action , but their attempts to buy ironclads overseas were frustrated as European nations confiscated ships being built for the Confederacy — especially in Russia , the only country to openly support the Union through the war . Only CSS Stonewall was completed , and she arrived in American waters just in time for the end of the war . \\n',\n"," \" Through the remainder of the war , ironclads saw action in the Union 's attacks on Confederate ports . Seven Union monitors , including USS Montauk , as well as two other ironclads , the ironclad frigate New Ironsides and a light @-@ draft USS Keokuk , participated in the failed attack on Charleston ; one was sunk . Two small ironclads , CSS Palmetto State and CSS Chicora participated in the defence of the harbor . For the later attack at Mobile Bay , the Union assembled four monitors as well as 11 wooden ships , facing the CSS Tennessee , the Confederacy 's most powerful ironclad and the gunboats CSS Morgan , CSS Gaines , CSS Selma . \\n\",\n"," ' On the western front , the Union built a formidable force of river ironclads , beginning with several converted riverboats and then contracting engineer James Eads of St. Louis , Missouri to build the City @-@ class ironclads . These excellent ships were built with twin engines and a central paddle wheel , all protected by an armored casement . They had a shallow draft , allowing them to journey up smaller tributaries , and were very well suited for river operations . Eads also produced monitors for use on the rivers , the first two of which differed from the ocean @-@ going monitors in that they contained a paddle wheel ( the USS Neosho and USS Osage ) . \\n',\n"," \" Arguably Eads vessels were some of the better ironclads of the Western Flotilla , but there were a number of other vessels that served valiantly with the fleet . All were of varying design , some more successful than others , and some were similar to standard riverboats but with armored side @-@ mounted paddle wheels . All were armed with various smoothbore and some rifled guns . If nothing else the experience of the American Civil War and its wild variety of competing ironclad designs , some more successful ( or disastrous ) than others , confirmed the emerging trade @-@ off or compromises required in applying the latest technological advances in iron armour manufacture , ship construction and gun design — to name a few — also going on in Europe . There was no such thing as a ' perfect ' ironclad which could be invincible in every possible encounter ; ship duels , standing up to forts , Brown & Blue @-@ water operations . \\n\",\n"," ' The Union ironclads played an important role in the Mississippi and tributaries by providing tremendous fire upon Confederate forts , installations and vessels with relative impunity to enemy fire . They were not as heavily armored as the ocean @-@ going monitors of the Union , but they were adequate for their intended use . More Western Flotilla Union ironclads were sunk by torpedoes ( mines ) than by enemy fire , and the most damaging fire for the Union ironclads was from shore installations , not Confederate vessels . \\n',\n"," ' = = = Lissa : First fleet battle = = = \\n',\n"," ' The first fleet battle , and the first ocean battle , involving ironclad warships was the Battle of Lissa in 1866 . Waged between the Austrian and Italian navies , the battle pitted combined fleets of wooden frigates and corvettes and ironclad warships on both sides in the largest naval battle between the battles of Navarino and Tsushima . \\n',\n"," ' The Italian fleet consisted of 12 ironclads and a similar number of wooden warships , escorting transports which carried troops intending to land on the Adriatic island of Lissa . Among the Italian ironclads were seven broadside ironclad frigates , four smaller ironclads , and the newly built Affondatore — a double @-@ turretted ram . Opposing them , the Austrian navy had seven ironclad frigates . \\n',\n"," ' The Austrians believed their ships to have less effective guns than their enemy , so decided to engage the Italians at close range and ram them . The Austrian fleet formed into an arrowhead formation with the ironclads in the first line , charging at the Italian ironclad squadron .

From the early 1870s to early 1880s most British naval officers thought that guns were about to be replaced as the main naval armament by the ram . Those who noted the tiny number of ships that had actually been sunk by ramming struggled to be heard . \\n\",\n"," ' The revival of ramming had a significant effect on naval tactics . Since the 17th century the predominant tactic of naval warfare had been the line of battle , where a fleet formed a long line to give it the best fire from its broadside guns . This tactic was totally unsuited to ramming , and the ram threw fleet tactics into disarray . The question of how an ironclad fleet should deploy in battle to make best use of the ram was never tested in battle , and if it had been , combat might have shown that rams could only be used against ships which were already stopped dead in the water . \\n',\n"," ' The ram finally fell out of favour in the 1880s , as the same effect could be achieved with a torpedo , with less vulnerability to quick @-@ firing guns . \\n',\n"," ' = = = Development of naval guns = = = \\n',\n"," ' The armament of ironclads tended to become concentrated in a small number of powerful guns capable of penetrating the armor of enemy ships at range ; calibre and weight of guns increased markedly to achieve greater penetration . Throughout the ironclad era navies also grappled with the complexities of rifled versus smoothbore guns and breech @-@ loading versus muzzle @-@ loading . \\n',\n"," ' HMS Warrior carried a mixture of 110 @-@ pounder 7 inch ( 180 mm ) breech @-@ loading rifles and more traditional 68 @-@ pounder smoothbore guns . Warrior highlighted the challenges of picking the right armament ; the breech @-@ loaders she carried , designed by Sir William Armstrong , were intended to be the next generation of heavy armament for the Royal Navy , but were shortly withdrawn from service . \\n',\n"," \" Breech @-@ loading guns seemed to offer important advantages . A breech @-@ loader could be reloaded without moving the gun , a lengthy process particularly if the gun then needed to be re @-@ aimed . The Warrior 's Armstrong guns also had the virtue of being lighter than an equivalent smoothbore and , because of their rifling , more accurate . Nonetheless , the design was rejected because of problems which plagued breech @-@ loaders for decades . \\n\",\n"," \" The weakness of the breech @-@ loader was the obvious problem of sealing the breech . All guns are powered by the explosive conversion of gunpowder into gas . This explosion propels the shot or shell out of the front of the gun , but also imposes great stresses on the gun @-@ barrel . If the breech — which experiences some of the greatest forces in the gun — is not entirely secure , then there is a risk that either gas will discharge through the breech or that the breech will break . This in turn reduces the muzzle velocity of the weapon and can also endanger the gun crew . The Warrior 's Armstrong guns suffered from both problems ; the shells were unable to penetrate the 4 @.@ 5 in ( 118 mm ) armor of Gloire , while sometimes the screw which closed the breech flew backwards out of the gun on firing . Similar problems were experienced with the breech @-@ loading guns which became standard in the French and German navies . \\n\",\n"," ' These problems influenced the British to equip ships with muzzle @-@ loading weapons of increasing power until the 1880s . After a brief introduction of 100 @-@ pounder or 9 @.@ 5 @-@ inch ( 240 mm ) smoothbore Somerset Gun , which weighed 6 @.@ 5 tons ( 6 @.@ 6 t ) , the Admiralty introduced 7 @-@ inch ( 178 mm ) rifled guns , weighing 7 tons . These were followed by a series of increasingly mammoth weapons — guns weighing 12 , 25 , 25 , 38 and finally 81 tons , with calibre increasing from 8 @-@ inch ( 203 mm ) to 16 @-@ inch ( 406 mm ) . \\n',\n"," ' The decision to retain muzzle @-@ loaders until the 1880s has been criticised by historians . However , at least until the late 1870s , the British muzzle @-@ loaders had superior performance in terms of both range and rate of fire than the French and Prussian breech @-@ loaders , which suffered from the same problems as had the first Armstrong guns . \\n',\n"," ' From 1875 onwards , the balance between breech- and muzzle @-@ loading changed . Captain de Bange invented a method of reliably sealing a breech , adopted by the French in 1873 . Just as compellingly , the growing size of naval guns made muzzle @-@ loading much more complicated . With guns of such size there was no prospect of hauling in the gun for re @-@ loading , or even re @-@ loading by hand , and complicated hydraulic systems were required for re @-@ loading the gun outside the turret without exposing the crew to enemy fire . In 1882 , the 81 @-@ ton , 16 @-@ inch ( 406 mm ) guns of HMS Inflexible fired only once every 11 minutes while bombarding Alexandria during the Urabi Revolt . The 100 @-@ ton , 450 mm ( 17 @.@ 72 inch ) guns of Caio Duilio could each fire a round every 15 minutes . \\n',\n"," ' In the Royal Navy , the switch to breech @-@ loaders was finally made in 1879 ; as well as the significant advantages in terms of performance , opinion was swayed by an explosion on board HMS Thunderer caused by a gun being double @-@ loaded , a problem which could only happen with a muzzle @-@ loading gun . \\n',\n"," \" The calibre and weight of guns could only increase so far . The larger the gun , the slower it would be to load , the greater the stresses on the ship 's hull , and the less the stability of the ship . The size of the gun peaked in the 1880s , with some of the heaviest calibres of gun ever used at sea . HMS Benbow carried two 16 @.@ 25 @-@ inch ( 413 mm ) breech @-@ loading guns , each weighing 110 tons — no British battleship would ever carry guns as large . The Italian 450 mm ( 17 @.@ 72 inch ) guns would be larger than any gun fitted to a battleship until the 18 @.@ 1 @-@ inch ( 460 mm ) armament of the Japanese Yamato class of World War II . One consideration which became more acute was that even from the original Armstrong models , following the Crimean War , range and hitting power far exceeded simple accuracy , especially at sea where the slightest roll or pitch of the vessel as ' floating weapons @-@ platform ' could negate the advantage of rifling . American ordnance experts accordingly preferred smoothbore monsters whose round shot could at least ' skip ' along the surface of the water . Actual effective combat ranges , they had learned during the Civil War , were comparable to those in the Age of Sail — though a vessel could now be smashed to pieces in only a few rounds . Smoke and the general chaos of battle only added to the problem . As a result , many naval engagements in the ' Age of the Ironclad ' were still fought at ranges within easy eyesight of their targets , and well below the maximum reach of their ships ' guns . \\n\",\n"," ' Another method of increasing firepower was to vary the projectile fired or the nature of the propellant . Early ironclads used black powder , which expanded rapidly after combustion ; this meant cannons had relatively short barrels , to prevent the barrel itself slowing the shell . The sharpness of the black powder explosion also meant that guns were subjected to extreme stress . One important step was to press the powder into pellets , allowing a slower , more controlled explosion and a longer barrel . A further step forward was the introduction of chemically different brown powder which combusted more slowly again . It also put less stress on the insides of the barrel , allowing guns to last longer and to be manufactured to tighter tolerances . \\n',\n"," ' The development of smokeless powder , based on nitroglycerine or nitrocellulose , by the French inventor Paul Vielle in 1884 was a further step allowing smaller charges of propellant with longer barrels . The guns of the pre @-@ Dreadnought battleships of the 1890s tended to be smaller in calibre compared to the ships of the 1880s , most often 12 in ( 305 mm ) , but progressively grew in length of barrel , making use of improved propellants to gain greater muzzle velocity . \\n',\n"," ' The nature of the projectiles also changed during the ironclad period . Initially , the best armor @-@ piercing projectile was a solid cast @-@ iron shot . Later , shot of chilled iron , a harder iron alloy , gave better armor @-@ piercing qualities . Eventually the armor @-@ piercing shell was developed . \\n',\n"," ' = = = Positioning of armament = = = \\n',\n"," ' = = = = Broadside ironclads = = = = \\n',\n"," ' The first British , French and Russian ironclads , in a logical development of warship design from the long preceding era of wooden ships of the line , carried their weapons in a single line along their sides and so were called \" broadside ironclads . \" Both Gloire and HMS Warrior were examples of this type . Because their armor was so heavy , they could only carry a single row of guns along the main deck on each side rather than a row on each deck . \\n',\n"," ' A significant number of broadside ironclads were built in the 1860s , principally in Britain and France , but in smaller numbers by other powers including Italy , Austria , Russia and the United States . The advantages of mounting guns on both broadsides was that the ship could engage more than one adversary at a time , and the rigging did not impede the field of fire . \\n',\n"," ' Broadside armament also had disadvantages , which became more serious as ironclad technology developed . Heavier guns to penetrate ever @-@ thicker armor meant that fewer guns could be carried . Furthermore , the adoption of ramming as an important tactic meant the need for ahead and all @-@ round fire . These problems led to broadside designs being superseded by designs that gave greater all @-@ round fire , which included central @-@ battery , turret , and barbette designs . \\n',\n"," ' = = = = Turrets , batteries and barbettes = = = = \\n',\n"," \" There were two main design alternatives to the broadside . In one design , the guns were placed in an armoured casemate amidships : this arrangement was called the ' box @-@ battery ' or ' centre @-@ battery ' . In the other , the guns could be placed on a rotating platform to give them a broad field of fire ; when fully armored , this arrangement was called a turret and when partially armored or unarmored , a barbette . \\n\",\n"," ' The centre @-@ battery was the simpler and , during the 1860s and 1870s , the more popular method . Concentrating guns amidships meant the ship could be shorter and handier than a broadside type . The first full @-@ scale centre @-@ battery ship was HMS Bellerophon of 1865 ; the French laid down centre @-@ battery ironclads in 1865 which were not completed until 1870 . Centre @-@ battery ships often , but not always , had a recessed freeboard enabling some of their guns to fire directly ahead . \\n',\n"," \" The turret was first used in naval combat on the USS Monitor in 1862 , with a type of turret designed by the Swedish engineer John Ericsson . A competing turret design was proposed by the British inventor Cowper Coles with a prototype of this installed on HMS Trusty in 1861 for testing and evaluation purposes . Ericsson 's turret turned on a central spindle , and Coles 's turned on a ring of bearings . Turrets offered the maximum arc of fire from the guns , but there were significant problems with their use in the 1860s . The fire arc of a turret would be considerably limited by masts and rigging , so they were unsuited to use on the earlier ocean @-@ going ironclads . The second problem was that turrets were extremely heavy . Ericsson was able to offer the heaviest possible turret ( guns and armour protection ) by deliberately designing a ship with very low freeboard . The weight thus saved from having a high broadside above the waterline was diverted to actual guns and armour . Low freeboard , however , also meant a smaller hull and therefore a smaller capacity for coal storage — and therefore range of the vessel . In many respects , the turreted , low @-@ freeboard Monitor and the broadside sailer HMS Warrior represented two opposite extremes in what an ' Ironclad ' was all about . The most dramatic attempt to compromise these two extremes , or ' squaring this circle ' , was designed by Captain Cowper Phipps Coles : HMS Captain , a dangerously low freeboard turret ship which nevertheless carried a full rig of sail , and which subsequently capsized not long after her launch in 1870 . Her half @-@ sister HMS Monarch was restricted to firing from her turrets only on the port and starboard beams . The third Royal Navy ship to combine turrets and masts was HMS Inflexible of 1876 , which carried two turrets on either side of the centre @-@ line , allowing both to fire fore , aft and broadside . \\n\",\n"," \" A lighter alternative to the turret , particularly popular with the French navy , was the barbette . These were fixed armored towers which held a gun on a turntable . The crew was sheltered from direct fire , but vulnerable to plunging fire , for instance from shore emplacements . The barbette was lighter than the turret , needing less machinery and no roof armor — though nevertheless some barbettes were stripped of their armor plate to reduce the top @-@ weight of their ships . The barbette became widely adopted in the 1880s , and with the addition of an armored ' gun @-@ house ' , transformed into the turrets of the pre @-@ Dreadnought battleships . \\n\",\n"," ' = = = Torpedoes = = = \\n',\n"," \" The ironclad age saw the development of explosive torpedoes as naval weapons , which helped complicate the design and tactics of ironclad fleets . The first torpedoes were static mines , used extensively in the American Civil War . That conflict also saw the development of the spar torpedo , an explosive charge pushed against the hull of a warship by a small boat . For the first time , a large warship faced a serious threat from a smaller one — and given the relative inefficiency of shellfire against ironclads , the threat from the spar torpedo was taken seriously . The U.S. Navy converted four of its monitors to become turretless armored spar @-@ torpedo vessels while under construction in 1864 – 5 , but these vessels never saw action . Another proposal , the towed or ' Harvey ' torpedo , involved an explosive on a line or outrigger ; either to deter a ship from ramming or to make a torpedo attack by a boat less suicidal . \\n\",\n"," \" A more practical and influential weapon was the self @-@ propelled or Whitehead torpedo . Invented in 1868 and deployed in the 1870s , the Whitehead torpedo formed part of the armament of ironclads of the 1880s like HMS Inflexible and the Italian Caio Duilio and Enrico Dandolo . The ironclad 's vulnerability to the torpedo was a key part of the critique of armored warships made by the Jeune Ecole school of naval thought ; it appeared that any ship armored enough to prevent destruction by gunfire would be slow enough to be easily caught by torpedo . In practice , however , the Jeune Ecole was only briefly influential and the torpedo formed part of the confusing mixture of weapons possessed by ironclads . \\n\",\n"," ' = = Armor and construction = = \\n',\n"," ' The first ironclads were built on wooden or iron hulls , and protected by wrought iron armor backed by thick wooden planking . Ironclads were still being built with wooden hulls into the 1870s . \\n',\n"," ' = = = Hulls : iron , wood and steel = = = \\n',\n"," ' Using iron construction for warships offered advantages for the engineering of the hull . However , unarmored iron had many military disadvantages , and offered technical problems which kept wooden hulls in use for many years , particularly for long @-@ range cruising warships . \\n',\n"," ' Iron ships had first been proposed for military use in the 1820s . In the 1830s and 1840s , France , Britain and the United States had all experimented with iron @-@ hulled but unarmored gunboats and frigates . However , the iron @-@ hulled frigate was abandoned by the end of the 1840s , because iron hulls were more vulnerable to solid shot ; iron was more brittle than wood , and iron frames more likely to fall out of shape than wood . \\n',\n"," ' The unsuitability of unarmored iron for warship hulls meant that iron was only adopted as a building material for battleships when protected by armor . However , iron gave the naval architect many advantages . Iron allowed larger ships and more flexible design , for instance the use of watertight bulkheads on the lower decks . Warrior , built of iron , was longer and faster than the wooden @-@ hulled Gloire . Iron could be produced to order and used immediately , in contrast to the need to give wood a long period of seasoning . And , given the large quantities of wood required to build a steam warship and the falling cost of iron , iron hulls were increasingly cost @-@ effective . The main reason for the French use of wooden hulls for the ironclad fleet built in the 1860s was that the French iron industry could not supply enough , and the main reason why Britain built its handful of wooden @-@ hulled ironclads was to make best use of hulls already started and wood already bought . \\n',\n"," ' Wooden hulls continued to be used for long @-@ range and smaller ironclads , because iron nevertheless had a significant disadvantage . Iron hulls suffered quick fouling by marine life , slowing the ships down — manageable for a European battlefleet close to dry docks , but a difficulty for long @-@ range ships . The only solution was to sheath the iron hull first in wood and then in copper , a laborious and expensive process which made wooden construction remain attractive . Iron and wood were to some extent interchangeable : the Japanese Kongō and Hiei ordered in 1875 were sister @-@ ships , but one was built of iron and the other of composite construction . \\n',\n"," ' After 1872 , steel started to be introduced as a material for construction . Compared to iron , steel allows for greater structural strength for a lower weight . The French Navy led the way with the use of steel in its fleet , starting with the Redoutable , laid down in 1873 and launched in 1876 . Redoutable nonetheless had wrought iron armor plate , and part of her exterior hull was iron rather than steel . \\n',\n"," ' Even though Britain led the world in steel production , the Royal Navy was slow to adopt steel warships . The Bessemer process for steel manufacture produced too many imperfections for large @-@ scale use on ships . French manufacturers used the Siemens @-@ Martin process to produce adequate steel , but British technology lagged behind . The first all @-@ steel warships built by the Royal Navy were the dispatch vessels Iris and Mercury , laid down in 1875 and 1876 . \\n',\n"," ' = = = Armor and protection schemes = = = \\n',\n"," \" Iron @-@ built ships used wood as part of their protection scheme . HMS Warrior was protected by 4 @.@ 5 in ( 114 mm ) of wrought iron backed by 15 in ( 381 mm ) of teak , the strongest shipbuilding wood . The wood played two roles , preventing spalling and also preventing the shock of a hit damaging the structure of the ship . Later , wood and iron were combined in ' sandwich ' armor , for instance in HMS Inflexible . \\n\",\n"," \" Steel was also an obvious material for armor . It was tested in the 1860s , but the steel of the time was too brittle and disintegrated when struck by shells . Steel became practical to use when a way was found to fuse steel onto wrought iron plates , giving a form of compound armor . This compound armor was used by the British in ships built from the late 1870s , first for turret armor ( starting with HMS Inflexible ) and then for all armor ( starting with HMS Colossus of 1882 ) . The French and German navies adopted the innovation almost immediately , with licenses being given for the use of the ' Wilson System ' of producing fused armor . \\n\",\n"," ' The first ironclads to have all @-@ steel armor were the Italian Caio Duilio and Enrico Dandolo . Though the ships were laid down in 1873 their armor was not purchased from France until 1877 . The French navy decided in 1880 to adopt compound armor for its fleet , but found it limited in supply , so from 1884 the French navy was using steel armor . Britain stuck to compound armor until 1889 . \\n',\n"," \" The ultimate ironclad armor was case hardened nickel @-@ steel . In 1890 , the U.S. Navy tested steel armor hardened by the Harvey process and found it superior to compound armor . For several years ' Harvey steel ' was the state of the art , produced in the U.S. , France , Germany , Britain , Austria and Italy . In 1894 , the German firm Krupp developed gas cementing , which further hardened steel armor . The German Kaiser Friedrich III , laid down in 1895 , was the first ship to benefit from the new ' Krupp armor ' and the new armor was quickly adopted ; the Royal Navy using it from HMS Canopus , laid down in 1896 . By 1901 almost all new battleships used Krupp armor , though the U.S. continued to use Harvey armor alongside until the end of the decade . \\n\",\n"," ' The equivalent strengths of the different armor plates was as follows : 15 in ( 381 mm ) of wrought iron was equivalent to 12 in ( 305 mm ) of either plain steel or compound iron and steel armor , and to 7 @.@ 75 in ( 197 mm ) of Harvey armor or 5 @.@ 75 in ( 146 mm ) of Krupp armor . \\n',\n"," \" Ironclad construction also prefigured the later debate in battleship design between tapering and ' all @-@ or @-@ nothing ' armour design . Warrior was only semi @-@ armoured , and could have been disabled by hits on the bow and stern . As the thickness of armor grew to protect ships from the increasingly heavy guns , the area of the ship which could be fully protected diminished . Inflexible 's armor protection was largely limited to the central citadel amidships , protecting boilers and engines , turrets and magazines , and little else . An ingenious arrangement of cork @-@ filled compartments and watertight bulkheads was intended to keep her stable and afloat in the event of heavy damage to her un @-@ armored sections . \\n\",\n"," ' = = Propulsion : steam and sail = = \\n',\n"," ' The first ocean @-@ going ironclads carried masts and sails like their wooden predecessors , and these features were only gradually abandoned . Early steam engines were inefficient ; the wooden steam fleet of the Royal Navy could only carry \" 5 to 9 days coal \" , and the situation was similar with the early ironclads . Warrior also illustrates two design features which aided hybrid propulsion ; she had retractable screws to reduce drag while under sail ( though in practice the steam engine was run at a low throttle ) , and a telescopic funnel which could be folded down to the deck level . \\n',\n"," ' Ships designed for coastal warfare , like the floating batteries of the Crimea , or USS Monitor and her sisters , dispensed with masts from the beginning . The British HMS Devastation , started in 1869 , was the first large , ocean @-@ going ironclad to dispense with masts . Her principal role was for combat in the English Channel and other European waters ; and while her coal supplies gave her enough range to cross the Atlantic , she would have had little endurance on the other side of the ocean . The Devastation and the similar ships commissioned by the British and Russian navies in the 1870s were the exception rather than the rule . Most ironclads of the 1870s retained masts , and only the Italian navy , which during that decade was focused on short @-@ range operations in the Adriatic , built consistently mastless ironclads . \\n',\n"," ' During the 1860s , steam engines improved with the adoption of double @-@ expansion steam engines , which used 30 – 40 % less coal than earlier models . The Royal Navy decided to switch to the double @-@ expansion engine in 1871 , and by 1875 they were widespread . However , this development alone was not enough to herald the end of the mast . Whether this was due to a conservative desire to retain sails , or was a rational response to the operational and strategic situation , is a matter of debate . A steam @-@ only fleet would require a network of coaling stations worldwide , which would need to be fortified at great expense to stop them falling into enemy hands . Just as significantly , because of unsolved problems with the technology of the boilers which provided steam for the engines , the performance of double @-@ expansion engines was rarely as good in practice as it was in theory . \\n',\n"," \" During the 1870s the distinction grew between ' first @-@ class ironclads ' or ' battleships ' on the one hand , and ' cruising ironclads ' designed for long @-@ range work on the other . The demands on first @-@ class ironclads for very heavy armor and armament meant increasing displacement , which reduced speed under sail ; and the fashion for turrets and barbettes made a sailing rig increasingly inconvenient . HMS Inflexible , launched in 1876 but not commissioned until 1881 , was the last British battleship to carry masts , and these were widely seen as a mistake . The start of the 1880s saw the end of sailing rig on ironclad battleships . \\n\",\n"," \" Sails persisted on ' cruising ironclads ' for much longer . During the 1860s , the French navy had produced the Alma and La Galissonnière classes as small , long @-@ range ironclads as overseas cruisers and the British had responded with ships like HMS Swiftsure of 1870 . The Russian ship General @-@ Admiral , laid down in 1870 and completed in 1875 , was a model of a fast , long @-@ range ironclad which was likely to be able to outrun and outfight ships like Swiftsure . Even the later HMS Shannon , often described as the first British armored cruiser , would have been too slow to outrun General @-@ Admiral . While Shannon was the last British ship with a retractable propellor , later armored cruisers of the 1870s retained sailing rig , sacrificing speed under steam in consequence . It took until 1881 for the Royal Navy to lay down a long @-@ range armored warship capable of catching enemy commerce raiders , HMS Warspite , which was completed in 1888 . While sailing rigs were obsolescent for all purposes by the end of the 1880s , rigged ships were in service until the early years of the 20th century . \\n\",\n"," ' The final evolution of ironclad propulsion was the adoption of the triple @-@ expansion steam engine , a further refinement which was first adopted in HMS Sans Pareil , laid down in 1885 and commissioned in 1891 . Many ships also used a forced draught to get additional power from their engines , and this system was widely used until the introduction of the steam turbine in the mid @-@ 1900s ( decade ) . \\n',\n"," ' = = Fleets = = \\n',\n"," \" While ironclads spread rapidly in navies worldwide , there were few pitched naval battles involving ironclads . Most European nations settled differences on land , and the Royal Navy struggled to maintain a deterrent parity with at least France , while providing suitable protection to Britain 's commerce and colonial outposts worldwide . Ironclads remained , for the British Royal Navy , a matter of defending the British Isles first and projecting power abroad second . Those naval engagements of the latter half of the 19th @-@ century which involved ironclads normally involved colonial actions or clashes between second @-@ rate naval powers .

The Royal Navy was the second to adopt ironclad warships , and it applied them worldwide in their whole range of roles . In the age of sail , the British strategy for war depended on the Royal Navy mounting a blockade of the ports of the enemy . Because of the limited endurance of steamships , this was no longer possible , so the British at times considered the risk @-@ laden plan of engaging an enemy fleet in harbor as soon as war broke out . To this end , the Royal Navy developed a series of ' coast @-@ defence battleships ' , starting with the Devastation class . These ' breastwork monitors ' were markedly different from the other high @-@ seas ironclads of the period and were an important precursor of the modern battleship . As long @-@ range monitors they could reach Bermuda unescorted , for example . However , they were still armed with only four heavy guns and were as vulnerable to mines and obstructions ( and enemy monitors ) as the original monitors of the Union Navy proved to be during the Civil War . The British prepared for an overwhelming mortar bombardment of Kronstadt by the close of the Crimean War , but never considered running the smoke @-@ ridden , shallow @-@ water gauntlet straight to St. Petersburg with ironclads . Likewise , monitors proved acutely unable to ' overwhelm ' enemy fortifications single @-@ handed during the American conflict , though their low @-@ profile and heavy armour protection made them ideal for running gauntlets . Mines and obstructions , however , negated these advantages — a problem the British Admiralty frequently acknowledged but never countered throughout the period . The British never laid down enough Devastation @-@ class ' battleships ' to instantly overwhelm Cherbourg , Kronstadt or even New York City with gunfire . Although throughout the 1860s and 1870s the Royal Navy was still in many respects superior to its potential rivals , by the early 1880s widespread concern about the threat from France and Germany culminated in the Naval Defence Act , which promulgated the idea of a ' two @-@ power standard ' , that Britain should possess as many ships as the next two navies combined . This standard provoked aggressive shipbuilding in the 1880s and 1890s . \\n\",\n"," \" British ships did not participate in any major wars in the ironclad period . The Royal Navy 's ironclads only saw action as part of colonial battles or one @-@ sided engagements like the bombardment of Alexandria in 1882 . Defending British interests against Ahmed ' Urabi 's Egyptian revolt , a British fleet opened fire on the fortifications around the port of Alexandria . A mixture of centre @-@ battery and turret ships bombarded Egyptian positions for most of a day , forcing the Egyptians to retreat ; return fire from Egyptian guns was heavy at first , but inflicted little damage , killing only five British sailors . Few Egyptian guns were actually dismounted , on the other hand , and the fortifications themselves were typically left intact . Had the Egyptians actually utilised the heavy mortars that were at their disposal , they might have quickly turned the tide , for the attacking British ironclads found it easy ( for accuracy 's sake ) to simply anchor whilst firing — perfect targets for high @-@ angle fire upon their thinly armoured topdecks . \\n\",\n"," ' The French navy built the first ironclad to try to gain a strategic advantage over the British , but were consistently out @-@ built by the British . Despite taking the lead with a number of innovations like breech @-@ loading weapons and steel construction , the French navy could never match the size of the Royal Navy . In the 1870s , the construction of ironclads ceased for a while in France as the Jeune Ecole school of naval thought took prominence , suggesting that torpedo boats and unarmored cruisers would be the future of warships . Like the British , the French navy saw little action with its ironclads ; the French blockade of Germany in the Franco @-@ Prussian War was ineffective , as the war was settled entirely on land . \\n',\n"," \" Russia built a number of ironclads , generally copies of British or French designs . Nonetheless , there were real innovations from Russia ; the first true type of ironclad armored cruiser , the General @-@ Admiral of the 1870s , and a set of remarkably badly designed circular battleships referred to as ' popovkas ' ( for Admiral Popov , who conceived the design ) . The Russian Navy pioneered the wide @-@ scale use of torpedo boats during the Russo @-@ Turkish War of 1877 – 1878 , mainly out of necessity because of the superior numbers and quality of ironclads used by the Turkish navy . Russia expanded her navy in the 1880s and 1890s with modern armored cruisers and battleships , but the ships were manned by inexperienced crews and politically appointed leadership , which enhanced their defeat in the Battle of Tsushima on 27 May 1905 . \\n\",\n"," ' The U.S. Navy ended the Civil War with about fifty monitor @-@ type coastal ironclads ; by the 1870s most of these were laid up in reserve , leaving the USA virtually without an ironclad fleet . Another five large monitors were ordered in the 1870s . The limitations of the monitor type effectively prevented the USA from projecting power overseas , and until the 1890s the USA would have come off badly in a conflict with even Spain or the Latin American powers . The 1890s saw the beginning of what became the Great White Fleet , and it was the modern pre @-@ Dreadnoughts and armored cruisers built in the 1890s which defeated the Spanish fleet in the Spanish – American War of 1898 . This started a new era of naval warfare . \\n',\n"," ' Ironclads were widely used in South America . Both sides used ironclads in the Chincha Islands War between Spain and the combined forces of Peru and Chile in the early 1860s . The powerful Spanish Numancia participated in the Battle of Callao but was unable to inflict significant damage to the Callao defences . Besides , Peru was able to deploy two locally built ironclads based on American Civil War designs , the Loa ( a wooden ship converted into a casemate ironclad ) and the Victoria ( a small monitor armed with a single 68 @-@ pdr gun ) , as well as two British @-@ built ironclads : Independencia , a centre @-@ battery ship , and the turret ship Huáscar . Numancia was the first ironclad to circumnavigate the world , arriving in Cádiz on 20 September 1867 , and earning the motto : \" Enloricata navis que primo terram circuivit \" [ \" First ironclad ship to sail around the world \" ] ) . In the War of the Pacific in 1879 , both Peru and Chile had ironclad warships , including some of those used a few years previously against Spain .

The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards , first ironclads and later armored cruisers . These ships engaged the Chinese Beiyang fleet which was superior on paper at least at the Battle of the Yalu River . Thanks to superior short @-@ range firepower , the Japanese fleet came off better , sinking or severely damaging eight ships and receiving serious damage to only four .

It was first published in September 1942 after being delayed for over a year because of the air @-@ raids on Great Britain during World War II and Eliot 's declining health . The title refers to a small Anglican community in Huntingdonshire , established by Nicholas Ferrar in the 17th century and scattered during the English Civil War . \\n\",\n"," \" The poem uses the combined image of fire and Pentecostal fire to emphasise the need for purification and purgation . According to the poet , humanity 's flawed understanding of life and turning away from God leads to a cycle of warfare , but this can be overcome by recognising the lessons of the past . Within the poem , the narrator meets a ghost that is a combination of various poets and literary figures . Little Gidding focuses on the unity of past , present , and future , and claims that understanding this unity is necessary for salvation . \\n\",\n"," ' = = Background = = \\n',\n"," \" Following the completion of the third Four Quartets poem , The Dry Salvages , Eliot 's health declined and he stayed in Shamley Green , Surrey while he recovered . During this time , Eliot started writing Little Gidding . The first draft was completed in July 1941 but he was dissatisfied with it . He believed the problems with the poem lay with his own inability to write , and that , precipitated by air raids on London , he had started the poem with too little preparation and had written it too quickly . After the first draft was written , he set the poem aside , and he left in September to lecture throughout Great Britain . \\n\",\n"," \" After months of not working on the poem , Eliot began to feel compelled to finish it ; it was not until August 1942 , however , that he started working on it again . In total , there were five drafts . The poem was finished by 19 September 1942 and published in the October New English Weekly . Little Gidding was intended to conclude the Four Quartets series , summarising Eliot 's views expressed in this series of poems . \\n\",\n"," ' Little Gidding was the home of an Anglican community established in 1626 by Nicholas Ferrar . The Ferrar household lived a Christian life according to High Church principles and the Book of Common Prayer . The religious community was dispersed during the English Civil War between Parliamentarians and Royalists but reformed , ending with the death of John Ferrar in 1657 . Eliot had visited the site in May 1936 . \\n',\n"," ' Unlike the other locations mentioned in the titles of the Four Quartets poems , Eliot had no direct connection to the original Christian community . As such , the community is supposed to represent almost any religious community . \\n',\n"," ' = = Poem = = \\n',\n"," ' Critics classify Little Gidding as a poem of fire with an emphasis on purgation and the Pentecostal fire . The beginning of the poem discusses time and winter , with attention paid to the arrival of summer . The images of snow , which provoke desires for a spiritual life , transition into an analysis of the four classical elements of fire , earth , air and water and how fire is the primary element of the four . Following this is a discussion on death and destruction , things unaccomplished , and regret for past events . \\n',\n"," \" While using Dante 's terza rima style , the poem continues by describing the Battle of Britain . The image of warfare merges with the depiction of Pentecost , and the Holy Spirit is juxtaposed with the air @-@ raids on London . In the second section , a ghost , representing the poets of the past stuck between worlds , begins talking to the narrator of the poem . The ghost discusses change , art in general , and how humankind is flawed . The only way to overcome the problematic condition of humanity , according to the ghost , is to experience purgation through fire . The fire is described in a manner similar to Julian of Norwich 's writing about God 's love and discussed in relationship to the shirt of Nessus , a shirt that burns its wearer . Little Gidding continues by describing the eternalness of the present and how history exists in a pattern . The poem concludes by explaining how sacrifice is needed to allow an individual to die into life and be reborn , and that salvation should be the goal of humankind . \\n\",\n"," ' = = Themes = = \\n',\n"," \" In terms of renewal , Eliot believed that suffering was needed for all of society before new life could begin . The original Little Gidding community was built for living on monastic lines , but the community was damaged and dispersed by Puritan forces during the English Civil War in 1646 . The church , the centre of the community , was restored in 1714 and again in 1853 . The image of religious renewal is combined with the image of the London air @-@ raids and the constant fighting and destruction within the world . This compound image is used to discuss the connection of holy places with the Holy Spirit , Pentecost , communion with the dead , and the repetition of history . The theme is also internal to Eliot 's own poems ; the image of the rose garden at the end Little Gidding is the image that begins Burnt Norton and the journey is made circular . Also , the depiction of time within the poem is similar to the way time operates within The Family Reunion . \\n\",\n"," ' Like the other poems making up the Four Quartets , Little Gidding deals with the past , present , and future , and humanity \\'s place within them as each generation is seemingly united . In the second section , there is a ghost who is the compilation of various poets , including Dante , Swift , Yeats , and others . When the ghost joins the poet , the narrator states \" Knowing myself yet being someone other \" . This suggests that the different times merge at the same time that the different personalities begin to merge , allowing a communication and connection with the dead . Later , in the fourth section , humanity is given a choice between the Holy Spirit or the bombing of London ; redemption or destruction . God \\'s love allows humankind to be redeemed and escape the living hell through purgation by fire . The end of the poem describes how Eliot has attempted to help the world as a poet . He parallels his work in language with working on the soul or working on society . \\n',\n"," ' The ghost , a combination of many literary figures , was originally addressed in the poem as \" Ser Brunetto \" before being revised as an ambiguous \" you \" . \" Ser Brunetto \" was Dante \\'s way of addressing Brunetto Latini , a former mentor whom he meets in Hell to which he has been condemned for sodomy . Eliot , in a letter to John Hayward dated 27 August 1942 , explained why he changed the wording : \\n',\n"," ' I think you will recognise that it was necessary to get rid of Brunetto for two reasons . The first is that the visionary figure has now become somewhat more definite and will no doubt be identified by some readers with Yeats though I do not mean anything so precise as that . However , I do not wish to take the responsibility of putting Yeats or anybody else into Hell and I do not want to impute to him the particular vice which took Brunetto there . Secondly , although the reference to that Canto is intended to be explicit , I wish the effect of the whole to be Purgatorial which is more appropriate . That brings us to the reference to swimming in fire which you will remember at the end of Purgatorio 26 where the poets are found . \\n',\n"," \" The theme of swimming through flames is connected to the depiction of Guido Guinizelli , a poet that influenced Dante , seeking such a state in Purgatorio XXVI . However , the depiction of swimming was transformed into an image of dancing , an act that appears throughout Yeats 's poetry , within purgatorial flames . The critic Dominic Manganiello suggests that , in combining the image of dancing with purgation , Eliot merges Dante 's and Yeats 's poetic themes . \\n\",\n"," ' = = Reception = = \\n',\n"," ' Critics such as Malcolm Cowley and Delmore Schwartz describe mixed emotions about the religiosity of the poem . Cowley emphasised the mystical nature of the poem and how its themes were closer to Buddhism than Anglicanism while mentioning his appreciation of many of the passages . Schwartz also mentioned the Buddhist images and his admiration for many of the lines in Little Gidding . F. B. Pinion believed that the fourth section of the poem costs \" Eliot more trouble and vexation than any passage of the same length he ever wrote , and is his greatest achievement in the Four Quartets . \" E. M. Forster did not like Eliot \\'s emphasis on pain and responded to the poem : \" Of course there \\'s pain on and off through each individual \\'s life ... You can \\'t shirk it and so on . But why should it be endorsed by the schoolmaster and sanctified by the priest until the fire and the rose are one when so much of it is caused by disease and bullies ? It is here that Eliot becomes unsatisfactory as a seer . \" Writing in 2003 , Roger Scruton wrote that in \" Little Gidding \" Eliot achieved \" that for which he envies Dante — namely , a poetry of belief , in which belief and words are one , and in which the thought cannot be prized free from the controlled and beautiful language \" . \\n',\n"," ' = The Portage to San Cristobal of A.H. = \\n',\n"," ' The Portage to San Cristobal of A.H. is a 1981 literary and philosophical novella by George Steiner , in which Jewish Nazi hunters find a fictional Adolf Hitler ( A.H. ) alive in the Amazon jungle thirty years after the end of World War II .

In Explaining Hitler , Ron Rosenbaum called The Portage \" A Frankenstein story \" , referring to Steiner \\'s fictive Hitler has having taken on a life of its own . Writing in Time magazine , Otto Friedrich described the book \" a philosophic fantasy of remarkable intensity \" , adding that by not refuting Hitler \\'s speech , Steiner deviates from the horrors of traditional Holocaust literature and ends the book \" on a note of bleak ambiguity \" . \\n',\n"," ' Morris Dickstein of The New York Times was more critical of the book , calling it \" a misconceived and badly executed novel , a sideshow distraction from the serious business of thinking through the unspeakable horrors of the Nazi era . \" He described it as \" wearisome \" that is \" suffocate [ d ] \" by too much \" fine writing \" ( belles @-@ lettres ) . He also complained that the characters are lifeless , and while they each have detailed histories , they are only \" verbal figments \" that do not separate them from one another . Finally Dickstein noted that because almost all the points of Hitler \\'s speech are drawn from some of Steiner \\'s earlier works , he \" unwittingly creates sympathy for Hitler by making him old and pathetic yet also lucid and brilliant — at once absurdly harmless and unconvincingly dangerous . \" \\n',\n"," ' In another review in The New York Times John Leonard wrote that while the book has its strong points , \" some wit , a catholic disdain , multiplicity of character and a South American swamp @-@ life that terrifies \" , its weaknesses are that \" the characters are really ideas , ... the symbols clash and there are too many echoes of better books by Kafka and Proust \" . But Leonard \\'s biggest criticism of the book was Hitler \\'s speech , which he called \" obscene \" , and Steiner \\'s decision to end the book at that point , which Leonard said \" not only denies the power of art to arrange and transcend , but ... makes me sick to my stomach . \" \\n',\n"," ' Writing in the American literary magazine Salmagundi , Alvin H.

He was struck by the book \\'s interplay between the landscape of swamp and jungle , and the \" landscape of speech \" — the former being \" brilliantly registered \" with its \" immense feeling of physicality \" , and the latter , \" even more dramatic \" in the way it exposes \" the dark underside of words \" and how its use and misuse reveals the true nature of a person . He was particularly impressed by the depiction of Nazi hunter Emmanuel Lieber and his role as representative of the Jewish consciousness . Rosenfeld noted that while Holocaust literature often either soars to \" expostulation and apostrophe \" , or sinks to \" a dwindling sob of elegiac lament \" , Steiner \\'s Lieber \" mediates between these two extremes , ... simultaneously records and mourns , coldly enumerates yet carries an immense affect \" . What did concern the reviewer , however , was the way Steiner used ideas from his earlier works , that he had put them \" virtually verbatim \" into Hitler \\'s mouth , creating the impression that \" Steiner \\'s understanding of Hitler were identical with the latter \\'s self @-@ understanding \" . Rosenfeld also questioned why the book had to end with Hitler \\'s speech . He said that Steiner \\'s fictive Hitler plays \" the devil \\'s game of language subversion \" , making \" madness [ sound ] like music \" , something the real Hitler had perfected . By stopping at this point , Rosenfeld felt that Steiner \" succumb [ s ] , rhetorically , to the seductive eloquence of negation \" , which undermines his own \" high standards of moral intelligence \" .

Steiner not only lets Hitler justify his past , he allows him the ( almost ) last word before the outside world invades . The fact that Steiner is Jewish made this speech in particular even more contentious . One critic , while acknowledging that Steiner always saw Hitler as \" the incarnation of unprecedented and unparalleled evil \" , felt that there was no clear distinction in the book between Steiner \\'s own views and those of his fictional Hitler , even going so far as to accuse Steiner , who rejects Jewish nationalism and is a critic of Israel \\'s treatment of the Palestinians , of anti @-@ Semitism . \\n',\n"," ' In contrast , a Time magazine article at the time felt that Steiner \\'s intention for the Hitler speech was to use it to explore his previously stated belief \" that Hitler wielded language as an almost supernatural force \" , drawing attention to Nazi hunter Emmanuel Lieber \\'s warning from the book regarding Hitler : \" There shall come a man who ... will know the grammar of hell and teach it to others . He will know the sounds of madness and loathing and make them seem music . \" \\n',\n"," ' Steiner responded to criticism that Hitler \\'s speech in this book is unchallenged by saying that it had been done before : for example Satan \\'s speech in Milton \\'s Paradise Lost ( 1667 ) , and The Grand Inquisitor \\'s speech in Dostoyevsky \\'s The Brothers Karamazov ( 1880 ) . He also reminded the reader that Hitler \\'s speech is balanced out earlier in the book by Lieber \\'s long monologue on the horrors of the Holocaust . Finally , Steiner said that his Hitler ( A.

A few species continued into the Cretaceous . Fossils have been found on every continent . During about 210 million years of evolutionary history , they adapted to a wide range of habitats , including fresh water , terrestrial , and even coastal marine environments . Their life history is well understood , with fossils known from the larval stage , metamorphosis , and maturity . Most temnospondyls were semiaquatic , although some were almost fully terrestrial , returning to the water only to breed . These temnospondyls were some of the first vertebrates fully adapted to life on land . Although temnospondyls are considered amphibians , many had characteristics , such as scales , claws , and armour @-@ like bony plates , that distinguish them from modern amphibians . \\n',\n"," ' Temnospondyls have been known since the early 19th century , and were initially thought to be reptiles . They were described at various times as batrachians , stegocephalians , and labyrinthodonts , although these names are now rarely used . Animals now grouped in Temnospondyli were spread out among several amphibian groups until the early 20th century , when they were found to belong to a distinct taxon based on the structure of their vertebrae . Temnospondyli means \" cut vertebrae \" , as each vertebra is divided into several parts . \\n',\n"," ' Experts disagree over whether temnospondyls were ancestral to modern amphibians ( frogs , salamanders , and caecilians ) , or whether the whole group died out without leaving any descendants . Different hypotheses have placed modern amphibians as the descendants of temnospondyls , another group of early tetrapods called lepospondyls , or even as descendants of both groups ( with caecilians evolving from lepospondyls and frogs and salamanders evolving from temnospondyls ) . Recent studies place a family of temnospondyls called the amphibamids as the closest relatives of modern amphibians . Similarities in teeth , skulls , and hearing structures link the two groups . \\n',\n"," ' = = Description = = \\n',\n"," ' Many temnospondyls are much larger than living amphibians , and superficially resemble crocodiles . Others are smaller and resemble salamanders . Most have broad , flat heads that are either blunt ( brevirostrine ) or elongated ( longirostrine ) . The skulls are rounded or triangular in shape when viewed from above , and are usually covered in pits and ridges . The rugged surfaces of bones may have supported blood vessels , which could transfer carbon dioxide to the bones to neutralize acidic build up in the blood ( early semiaquatic tetrapods would have had difficulty expelling carbon dioxide from their bodies while on land , and these dermal bones may have been an early solution to the problem ) . Many temnospondyls also have canal @-@ like grooves in their skulls called sensory sulci . The sulci , which usually run around the nostrils and eye sockets , are part of a lateral line system used to detect vibrations in water . As semiaquatic animals , most temnospondyls have small limbs with four toes on each front foot and five on each hind foot . Terrestrial temnospondyls have larger , thicker limbs , and some even have claws . One unusual terrestrial temnospondyl , Fayella , has relatively long limbs for its body , and probably lived as an active runner able to chase prey . \\n',\n"," ' Homologues of most of the bones of temnospondyls are also seen in other early tetrapods , aside from a few bones in the skull , such as interfrontals , internasals , and interparietals , that have developed in some temnospondyl taxa . Most temnospondyls have tabular horns in the backs of their skulls , rounded projections of bone separated from the rest of the skull by indentations called otic notches ; in some temnospondyls , such as Zatrachys , they are pointed and very prominent . Among the most distinguishing features of temnospondyls are the interpterygoid vacuities , two large holes in the back of the palate . Another pair of holes , choanae , are present in front of these vacuities , and connect the nasal passage with the mouth . Temnospondyls often have teeth on their palates , as well as in their jaws . Some of these teeth are so large , they are referred to as tusks . In some temnospondyls , such as Nigerpeton , tusks in the lower jaw pierce the palate and emerge through openings in the top of the skull . \\n',\n"," ' Very little is known of the soft tissue of temnospondyls . A block of sandstone , described in 2007 from the Early Carboniferous Mauch Chunk Formation of Pennsylvania , included impressions of the bodies of three temnospondyls . These impressions show , when alive , they had smooth skin , robust limbs with webbed feet , and a ridge of skin on their undersides . Trackways referable to small temnospondyls have also been found in Carboniferous and Permian rocks . The trackways , called batrachichni , are usually found in strata deposited around freshwater environments , suggesting the animals had some ties to the water . \\n',\n"," ' Unlike modern amphibians , many temnospondyls are covered in small , closely packed scales . The undersides of most temnospondyls are covered in rows of large ventral plates . During early stages of development , they first have only small , rounded scales . Fossils show , as the animals grew , the scales on the undersides of their bodies developed into large , wide ventral plates . The plates overlap each other in a way that allows a wide range of flexibility . Later semiaquatic temnospondyls , such as trematosaurs and capitosaurs , have no evidence of scales . They may have lost scales to make movement easier under water or to allow cutaneous respiration , the absorption of oxygen through the skin . \\n',\n"," ' Several groups of temnospondyls have large bony plates on their backs . One temnospondyl , Peltobatrachus , has armour @-@ like plating that covers both its back and underside . The temnospondyl Laidleria also has extensive plating on its back . Most members of the family Dissorophidae also have armor , although it only covers the midline of the back with two narrow rows of plates . Other temnospondyls , such as Eryops , have been found with small , disc @-@ like bony scutes that were in life probably embedded in the skin . All of these temnospondyls were adapted to a terrestrial lifestyle . Armor may have offered protection from predators in the case of Peltobatrachus . The scutes may have provided stability for the spine , as they would have limited flexibility and may have been connected by strong ligaments . Temnospondyls such as Sclerothorax and Eryops that may have been at least partly terrestrial also have long neural spines on top of their vertebrae that would have stabilized the spine . Bony scutes are also seen in plagiosaurs , but unlike Peltobatrachus , Laidleria , Eryops , and dissorophids , these animals are thought to have been fully aquatic . Plagiosaurs may have inherited their armor from a terrestrial ancestor , as both Peltobatrachus and Laidleria have been considered close relatives of the group . \\n',\n"," \" Temnospondyls ' vertebrae are divided into several segments . In living tetrapods , the main body of the vertebra is a single piece of bone called the centrum , but in temnospondyls , this region was divided into a pleurocentrum and intercentrum . Two types of vertebrae are recognized in temnospondyls : stereospondylous and rhachitomous vertebrae . In rhachitomous vertebrae , the intercentra are large and wedge @-@ shaped , and the pleurocentra are relatively small blocks that fit between them . Both elements support a spine @-@ like neural arch , and well @-@ developed interlocking projections called zygapophyses strengthen the connections between vertebrae . The strong backbone and strong limbs of many ratchitomous temnospondyls allowed them to be partially , and in some cases fully , terrestrial . In stereospondylous vertebrae , the pleurocentra have been lost entirely , with the intercentra enlarged as the main body of the vertebrae . This weaker type of backbone indicates the stereospondylous temnospondyls spent more time in water . \\n\",\n"," ' = = History of study = = \\n',\n"," ' Temnospondyli was named by German palaeontologist Karl Alfred von Zittel in his second edition of Handbuch der Palaeontologie , published in 1888 . Temnospondyl remains were known since the early part of the 19th century , however . The earliest described temnospondyl was Mastodonsaurus , named by Georg Friedrich Jaeger in 1828 . Jaeger named Mastodonsaurus from a single tooth , and considered it a reptile . Mastodonsaurus means \" breast tooth lizard \" after the nipple @-@ like shape of the tip of the tooth . \\n',\n"," ' The naming of these first specimens was disputed , however . Leopold Fitzinger named the animal Batrachosaurus in 1837 . In 1841 , English palaeontologist Richard Owen referred to the genus as Labyrinthodon to describe its highly folded or labyrinthine teeth . Owen thought the name Mastodonsaurus \" ought not to be retained , because it recalls unavoidably the idea of the mammalian genus Mastodon , or else a mammilloid form of the tooth ... and because the second element of the word , saurus , indicates a false affinity , the remains belonging , not to the Saurian , but to the Batrachian order of Reptiles . \" Owen recognized the animal was not a \" saurian \" reptile , yet he also referred Jaeger \\'s Phytosaurus to the genus . Although the two genera both have similarly sized conical teeth , Phytosaurus was later found to be a crocodile @-@ like reptile . Additional material , including skulls , firmly placed Labyrinthodon as an amphibian . Jaeger also named Salamandroides giganteus in 1828 , basing it on partial occiput , or back portion of the skull . In 1833 , he described a complete skull of S. giganteus that had the same teeth as his Mastodonsaurus , making it the first known complete skull of a temnospondyl . Because Mastodonsaurus was named first , it has precedence over the other names as a senior subjective synonym . Batrachosaurus is still used as the name of an unrelated brachyopid temnospondyl . \\n',\n"," ' Mastodonsaurus and other similar animals were referred to as labyrinthodonts , named like Labyrinthodon for teeth that were highly folded in cross section . Owen \\'s \" Labyrinthodon Jaegeri \" was later found at Guy \\'s Cliffe , England by paleontologist William Buckland . Other specimens were found in the red sandstone of Warwickshire . As more fossils were uncovered in England , Owen depicted these labyrinthodonts as the \" highest \" form of batrachian and compared them to crocodiles , which he considered the highest form of reptiles . He also noted the large labyrinthodonts of the Keuper ( a unit of rocks that dates to the Late Triassic ) were younger than more advanced reptiles in the Magnesian and Zechstein , which are Late Permian in age . Owen used these fossils to counter the notion that reptiles evolved from a sequential progression from early amphibians ( what he called \" metamorphosed fishes \" ) . \\n',\n"," ' In addition to Mastodonsaurus , some of the earliest named genera included Metopias and Rhombopholis in 1842 , Zygosaurus in 1848 , Trematosaurus in 1849 , Baphetes and Dendrerpeton in 1853 , Capitosaurus in 1858 , and Dasyceps in 1859 . Baphetes is now placed as an early tetrapod outside Temnospondyli , and Rhombopholis is now considered a prolacertiform reptile . \\n',\n"," ' Later in the 19th century , temnospondyls were classified as various members of Stegocephalia , a name coined by American paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope in 1868 . Cope placed stegocephalians in the class Batrachia , the name then used for Amphibia . Stegocephalia means \" roof @-@ headed \" in Greek , a reference to the wide , flat heads of temnospondyls and other early tetrapods . During this time , palaeontologists considered temnospondyls to be amphibians because they possessed three main features : gill arches in juvenile skeletons , indicating they were amphibious for at least the first part of their lives ; ribs that do not connect at the underside of the rib cage ; and deep pits in the skull that were interpreted as space for mucous glands . \\n',\n"," ' Several suborders of stegocephalians were recognized in the late 19th and early 20th centuries . Animals now regarded as temnospondyls were primarily labyrinthodonts , but some were classified in the Branchiosauria . Branchiosaurs were small @-@ bodied and had simple conical teeth , while labyrinthodonts were larger and had complex , folded dentin and enamel in their teeth . Branchiosauria included only a few forms , such as Branchiosaurus from Europe and Amphibamus from North America , that had poorly developed bones , external gills , and no ribs . Some skeletons of Amphibamus were later found with long ribs , prompting its reassignment to Microsauria ( although more detailed studies found it to be a temnospondyl ) . Soft tissue , such as scales and external gills , were found in many well @-@ preserved branchiosaur fossils from Germany . In the early 20th century , branchiosaurs would be recognized as larval forms of temnospondyls lacking many of the typical features that define the group , and is no longer recognized as a distinct group . \\n',\n"," ' Other animals that would later be classified as temnospondyls were placed in a group called Ganocephala , characterized by plate @-@ like skull bones , small limbs , fish @-@ like scales , and branchial arches . Unlike labyrinthodonts , they did not have parietal foramena , small holes in their skulls behind their eye sockets . Archegosaurus , Dendrerpeton , Eryops and Trimerorhachis were placed in this group and were considered to be the most primitive members of Reptilia . Their rhachitomous vertebrae , notochord , and lack of occipital condyles ( which attached the head to the neck ) were features that were also shared with fishes . Thus , they were considered a link between early fishes and more advanced forms such as stegocephalians . \\n',\n"," ' Another group called Microsauria was named by Cope in 1868 . Cope classified Microsauria as a subgroup of Labyrinthodontia , placing many small , amphibian @-@ like animals within it . Among them were Dendrerpeton , once placed in Ganocephala . Dendrerpeton was later placed as a labyrinthodont with other temnospondyls , but confusion existed for many years over the classification of small amphibians . \\n',\n"," ' By the end of the 19th century , most of what are today regarded as temnospondyls were placed in the suborder Labyrinthodonta . American paleontologist Ermine Cowles Case called it Labyrinthodonta vera or \" true labyrinthodonts \" . The names Stegocephalia and Labyrinthodontia were used interchangeably to refer to the order in which it belonged . The labyrinthodontian suborders Microsauria and Branchiosauria , both of which contain temnospondyls , were distinct from Labyrinthodonta . Within Labyrinthodonta were the groups Rhachitomi , Labyrinthodonti , and Embolerimi . Members of Rhachitomi , such as Archegosaurus and Eryops , had rhachitomous vertebrae with enlarged intercentra that displaced the pleurocentra . Labyrinthodonti , such as Mastodonsaurus , Trematosaurus , and Micropholis , had lost their pleurocentra , and the intercentra made up the entire body of the vertebrae . Embolerimi had intercentra and pleurocentra that were of equal size . Embolomeres are now identified as reptiliomorphs distantly related to temnospondyls . \\n',\n"," \" In 1888 , von Zittel divided stegocephalians among three taxa : Lepospondyli , Temnospondyli , and Stereospondyli . He placed microsaurs in Lepospondyli , a group which he characterized as having simple , spool @-@ shaped vertebral centra . Temnospondyli included forms with the centra divided into pleurocentra and intercentra . All members of Stereospondyli had amphicoelous centra composed only of the intercentra . Cope objected to von Zittel 's classification , considering the vertebrae of lepospondyls and stereospondyls indistinguishable because each had a simple spool shape . He continued to use Ganocephala and Labyrinthodonta ( which he alternatively referred to as Rhachitomi ) to distinguish animals based on the absence or presence of occipital condyles . \\n\",\n"," \" Temnospondyli became a commonly used name at the turn of the century . Paleontologists included both embolomeres and rhachitomes in the group . Cope 's Ganocephala and Labyrinthodonta fell out of use . In 1919 , British paleontologist D. M. S. Watson proposed that the evolutionary history of these large amphibians could be seen through changes in their vertebrae . Embolomerous forms in the Carboniferous graded into rhachitomous forms in the Permian , and finally into stereospondyls in the Triassic . More importantly , Watson began using the term Labyrinthodontia to refer to these groups . The name Temnospondyli was rarely used in the decades that followed . Swedish paleontologist Gunnar Säve @-@ Söderbergh removed embolomeres from the group , narrowing its scope to rhachitomes and stereospondyls . His classification of labyrinthodonts was based heavily on characteristics of the skull rather than the vertebrae . \\n\",\n"," ' American paleontologist Alfred Romer brought the name Temnospondyli back into use in the later 20th century . Säve @-@ Söderbergh used the name Labyrinthodontia in a strict sense ( sensu stricto ) to refer to Rhachitomi and Stereospondyli , excluding Embolomeri . Romer agreed with this classification , but used the name Temnospondyli to avoid confusion with Labyrinthodontia in its wider sense ( sensu lato ) . Unlike modern temnospondyl classification , however , Romer included the primitive Ichthyostegalia in the group . \\n',\n"," ' = = Evolutionary history = = \\n',\n"," ' = = = Carboniferous and Early Permian = = = \\n',\n"," ' Temnospondyls first appeared in the Early Carboniferous around 330 million years ago ( Mya ) .

They resembled salamanders , and some taxa , such as the genus Branchiosaurus , even retained external gills like the modern @-@ day axolotl . During the latest Carboniferous and Early Permian around 300 Mya , several groups , such as the dissorophids and trematopids evolved strong , robust limbs and vertebrae and became adapted to life on land while others such as the eryopids , developed into large semiaquatic predators . The dvinosaurs , a group of small aquatic temnospondyls , evolved from terrestrial ancestors in the Late Carboniferous . \\n',\n"," ' = = = Late Permian = = = \\n',\n"," ' During the Late Permian , increasing aridity and the diversification of reptiles contributed into a decline in terrestrial temnospondyls , but semiaquatic and fully aquatic temnospondyls continued to flourish , including the large Melosaurus of Eastern Europe .

During the Triassic period , these animals dominated the freshwater ecosystems , evolving in a range of both small and large forms . During the Early Triassic ( 251 @.@ 0 - 245 @.@ 0 Mya ) one group of successful long @-@ snouted fish @-@ eaters , the trematosauroids , even adapted to a life in the sea , the only known amphibians to do so with the exception of the modern crab @-@ eating frog .

Metoposaurids are distinguished from capitosauroids by the positioning of their eye sockets near the front of their skulls . Another group of stereospondyls , the plagiosaurs , had wide heads with external gills , and adapted to life at the bottom of lakes and rivers . By this time , temnospondyls had become a common and widespread component of semiaquatic ecosystems . Some temnospondyls , such as Cryobatrachus and Kryostega , even inhabited Antarctica , which was covered in temperate forests at the time . \\n',\n"," ' Triassic temnospondyls were often the dominant semiaquatic animals in their environments . Large assemblages of metoposaurs with hundreds of individuals preserved together have been found in the southwestern United States . They have often been interpreted as mass death events caused by droughts in floodplain environments . Recent studies show these dense assemblages were instead probably the result of currents accumulating dead individuals in certain areas . These environments seem to have had little diversity , as they were inhabited almost exclusively by metoposaurs . \\n',\n"," ' The Triassic @-@ Jurassic extinction event around 199 @.@ 6 Mya led to the extinction of most Mesozoic temnospondyls . The brachyopoids survived , as well as a few capitosauroids and trematosauroids . While the latter two groups soon became extinct , brachyopoids persisted and grew to large sizes during the Jurassic . Among brachyopoids , the brachyopids flourished in China and the chigutisaurids became common in Gondwana . The most recent known temnospondyl was the giant chigutisaurid Koolasuchus , known from the Early Cretaceous of Australia . It survived in rift valleys that were too cold in the winter for crocodiles that normally would have competed with them . Koolasuchus was one of the largest of the brachyopoids , with an estimated weight of 500 kg ( 1 @,@ 100 lb ) . \\n',\n"," ' = = Classification = = \\n',\n"," ' Originally , temnospondyls were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae . Early forms , with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements , were placed in the suborder Rachitomi , and large Triassic aquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder Stereospondyli . With the recent growth of phylogenetics , this classification is no longer viable . The basic rhachitomous condition is found in many primitive tetrapods , and is not unique to one group of temnospondyls . Moreover , the distinction between rhachitomous and stereospondylous vertebrae is not entirely clear . Some temnospondyls have rhachitomous , semirhachitomous , and sterospondylous vertebrae at different points in the same vertebral column . Other taxa have intermediate morphologies that do not fit into any category . Rachitomi is no longer recognized as a group , but Stereospondyli is still considered valid .

Additional features were given by Godfrey et al . ( 1987 ) , including the contact between the postparietal and exoccipital at the back of the skull , small projections ( uncinate processes ) on the ribs , and a pelvic girdle with each side having a single iliac blade .

Balanerpeton woodi is the oldest species , having been present over 330 million years ago during the Viséan stage of the Early Carboniferous . Recent analyses place Dendrerpetontidae outside Edopoidea in a more derived position . Other primitive temnospondyls include Capetus and Iberospondylus . Saharastega and Nigerpeton , both described in 2005 from Niger , are also primitive yet come from the Late Permian . They are almost 40 million years younger than other basal temnospondyls , implying a long ghost lineage of species that are not yet known in the fossil record . \\n',\n"," ' In 2000 , paleontologists Adam Yates and Anne Warren produced a revised phylogeny of more derived temnospondyls , naming several new clades . Two major clades were Euskelia and Limnarchia . Euskelia includes the temnospondyls that were once called rhachitomes and includes two subfamilies , the Dissorophoidea and the Eryopoidea . Dissorophoids include small , mostly terrestrial temnospondyls that may be the ancestors of modern amphibians . Eryopoids include larger temnospondyls like Eryops . The second major clade , Limnarchia , includes most Mesozoic temnospondyls , as well as some Permian groups . Within Limnarchia are the superfamily Archegosauroidea and the most derived temnospondyls , the stereospondyls . \\n',\n"," ' Yates and Warren also named Dvinosauria , a clade of small aquatic temnospondyls from the Carboniferous , Permian , and Triassic . They placed Dvinosauria within Limnarchia , but more recent studies disagree on their position . For example , a 2007 study places them even more basal than euskelians , while a 2008 study keeps them as basal limnarchians . \\n',\n"," ' Within Stereospondyli , Yates and Warren erected two major clades : Capitosauria and Trematosauria . Capitosaurs include large semiaquatic temnospondyls like Mastodonsaurus with flat heads and eyes near the back of the skull . Trematosaurs include a diversity of temnospondyls , including large marine trematosauroids , aquatic plagiosaurs , brachyopoids that survived into the Cretaceous , and metoposauroids with eyes near the front of their heads . In 2000 , paleontologists Rainer Schoch and Andrew Milner named a third major clade of stereospondyls , the Rhytidostea . This group included more primitive stereospondyls that could not be placed in either Capitosauria or Trematosauria , and included groups like Lydekkerinidae , Rhytidosteidae , and Brachyopoidea . While Capitosauria and Trematosauria are still widely used , Rhytidostea is not often supported as a true clade in recent analyses . Rhytidosteids and brachyopoids are now grouped with trematosaurians , but lydekkerinids are still considered to be a primitive family of stereospondyls . \\n',\n"," \" A new phylogeny of temnospondyls was offered by paleontologist Rainer Schoch in 2013 . It supported many of the clades that were found by Yates and Warren , but it did not find support for their division of derived stereospondyls into Euskelia and Limnarchia . Eryopids were found to be more closely related to stereospondyls than to dissorophoids , which were grouped with dvinosaurs . The clade including Eryopidae and Stereospondylomorpha was named Eryopiformes . In addition , Schoch named the clade containing all temnospondyls except edopoids Eutemnospondyli and reinstated the name Rhachitomi for the clade containing all temnospondyls except edopoids and dendrerpetontids . Below is the cladogram from Schoch 's analysis : \\n\",\n"," ' = = = Relationship to modern amphibians = = = \\n',\n"," ' Modern amphibians ( frogs , salamanders , and caecilians ) are classified in Lissamphibia . Lissamphibians appear to have arisen in the Permian . Molecular clock estimates place the first lissamphibian in the Late Carboniferous , but the first member of Batrachia ( frogs and salamanders , but not caecilians ) is estimated to have appeared in the Middle Permian using the same technique . Using fossil evidence , there are three main theories for the origin of modern amphibians . \\n',\n"," ' One is that they evolved from dissorophoid temnospondyls . Another is that they evolved from lepospondyls , most likely the lysorophians . A third hypothesis is that caecilians descended from lepospondyls and frogs and salamanders evolved from dissorophoids . \\n',\n"," ' Recently , the theory that temnospondyls were the ancestors of all lissamphibians has gained wide support . The skull morphology of some small temnospondyls has been compared to those of modern frogs and salamanders , but the presence of bicuspid , pedicellate teeth in small , paedomorphic or immature temnospondyls has been cited as the most convincing argument in favor of the temnospondyl origin of lissamphibians . Seen in lissamphibians and many dissorophoid temnospondyls , pedicellate teeth have calcified tips and bases . During the development of most tetrapods , teeth begin to calcify at their tips . Calcification normally proceeds downward to the base of the tooth , but calcification from the tip stops abruptly in pedicellate teeth . Calcification resumes at the base , leaving an area in the center of the tooth uncalcified . This pattern is seen in living amphibians and fossils . \\n',\n"," ' The dissorophoid family Amphibamidae is thought to be most closely related to Lissamphibia . In 2008 , an amphibamid called Gerobatrachus hottoni was named from Texas and was nicknamed the \" frogamander \" for its frog @-@ like head and salamander @-@ like body . It was thought to be the most closely related temnospondyl to lissamphibians and was placed as the sister taxon of the group in a phylogenetic analysis . Another species of amphibamid called Doleserpeton annectens is now thought to be even more closely related to lissamphibians . Unlike Gerobatrachus , Doleserpeton was known since 1969 , and the presence of pedicellate teeth in its jaws has led some paleontologists to conclude soon after its naming that it was a relative of modern amphibians . It was first described as a \" protolissamphibian \" , and the specific name annectens means \" connecting \" in reference to its inferred transitional position between temnospondyls and lissamphibians . The structure of its tympanum , a disk @-@ like membrane that functions like an ear drum , is similar to that of frogs and has also been used as evidence for a close relationship . Other features including the shape of the palate and the back of the skull , the short ribs , and the smooth skull surface also point to it being a closer relative of lissamphibians than is Gerobatrachus . Below is a cladogram modified from Sigurdsen and Bolt ( 2010 ) showing the relationships of Gerobatrachus , Doleserpeton , and Lissamphibia : \\n',\n"," ' = = Paleobiology = = \\n',\n"," ' = = = Feeding = = = \\n',\n"," ' Although the earliest temnospondyls were primarily semiaquatic , they had the ability to feed on land . Later , eryopoids and dissorophoids , some well adapted to terrestrial life , also fed on land . Some eryopoids became better adapted toward life in water , and shifted their diets toward aquatic organisms . The first primarily aquatic feeders were archegosaurs in the Permian . Trematosaurs and capitosaurs became independently aquatic and also returned to this type of feeding . \\n',\n"," ' Most aquatic stereospondyls have flattened heads . When feeding , they probably opened their mouths by lifting their skulls instead of lowering their lower jaws . The jaw mechanics of the plagiosaurid Gerrothorax is well known , and is one of the most highly adapted . Gerrothorax is thought to have lifted its skull to around 50 ° above horizontal through the flexing of the atlanto @-@ occipital joint between the occipital condyles of the skull and the atlas vertebra of the neck . As the skull is raised , the quadrate bone pushes forward and causes the lower jaw to protrude outward . Other stereospondyls probably also lifted their skulls , but they are not as well adapted for such movement . D.M.S. Watson was the first to suggest skull lifting as a means of feeding in temnospondyls . He envisioned that Mastodonsaurus , a much larger temnospondyl than Gerrothorax , was able to make the same movement . Paleontologist A.L. Panchen also supported the idea in 1959 , suggesting that Batrachosuchus also fed in this way . At the time it was thought that these temnospondyls lifted their heads with strong jaw muscles , but it is now thought that they used larger muscles in the neck that were attached to the large pectoral girdle . Plagiosuchus , a close relative of Gerrothorax , also has a hyobranchial skeleton that muscles may have attached to . Plagiosuchus has very small teeth and a large area for muscle attachment behind the skull , suggesting that it could suction feed by rapidly opening its mouth . \\n',\n"," ' Unlike semiaquatic temnospondyls , terrestrial temnospondyls have skulls that are adapted for biting land @-@ living prey . The sutures between the bones of the skull in the dissorophoid Phonerpeton are able to withstand a high degree of compression . Compressive forces would have been experienced when biting down on prey . Earlier aquatic tetrapods and tetrapod ancestors differ from temnospondyls like Phonerpeton in that their skulls were also built to withstand tension . This tension would have been experienced during suction feeding underwater . Temnospondyls like Phonerpeton were among the first tetrapods that were almost exclusively terrestrial and fed by biting . \\n',\n"," ' = = = Reproduction = = = \\n',\n"," ' Temnospondyls , like all amphibians , reproduced in aquatic environments .

Several fossils were described from the Early Permian of Texas in 1998 that may be egg masses of dissorophoid temnospondyls . They were the first known fossils of amphibian eggs . The fossils consist of small disks with thin membranes that are probably vitelline membranes and halo @-@ like areas surrounding them that are most likely mucous coatings . They are attached to plant fossils , suggesting that these temnospondyls laid eggs on aquatic plants much like modern frogs . The mucous membranes show that the eggs were laid by amphibians , not fish ( their eggs lack mucous ) , but the type of amphibian that laid them cannot be known because no body fossils are preserved with the eggs . The eggs are thought to be from dissorophoids because they are likely to be close relatives of modern amphibians , and probably had similar reproductive strategies . They are also the most common amphibians from the deposit in which the eggs were found . \\n',\n"," \" One temnospondyl , the dvinosaur Trimerorhachis , may have brooded young in an area between the gills called the pharyngeal pouch . Small bones belonging to younger Trimerorhachis individuals have been found in these pouches . The living Darwin 's Frog is also a mouth brooder and would be the closest modern analogue to Trimerorhachis if it cared for its young in this way . An alternative possibility is that Trimerorhachis was cannibalistic , eating its young like many amphibians do today . If this was the case , the bones of these smaller individuals were originally located in the throat and were pushed into the pharyngeal pouch as the animal fossilized . \\n\",\n"," ' Body impressions of Early Carboniferous temnospondyls from Pennsylvania suggest that some terrestrial temnospondyls mated on land like some modern amphibians . They reproduced through internal fertilization rather than mating in water . The presence of three individuals in one block of sandstone shows that the temnospondyls were gregarious . The head of one individual rests under the tail of another in what may be a courtship display . Internal fertilization and similar courtship behavior are seen in modern salamanders . \\n',\n"," ' = = = Growth = = = \\n',\n"," ' While most types of temnospondyls are distinguished on the basis of features in mature specimens , several are known from juvenile and larval specimens . Metamorphosis is seen in dissorophoids , eryopids , and zatrachydids , with aquatic larvae developing into adults capable of living on land . Several types of dissorophoids do not fully metamorphose , but retain features of juveniles such as gills and small body size in what is known as neoteny . Dvinosaurians and the plagiosaurid Gerrothorax were also neotenic because they retained gills , but they are only known from adult specimens . \\n',\n"," ' Temnospondyl larvae are often distinguished by poorly developed bones and the presence of a hyobranchial apparatus , a series of bones that gills would attach to in life . However , some fully mature temnospondyls also possess hyobranchial bones but did not have external gills . A dense covering of scales is also seen in larvae and adults . Major body changes occur in metamorphosis , including the reshaping and strengthening of skull bones , the thickening of postcranial bones , and an increase in body size . \\n',\n"," ' Temnospondyls like Sclerocephalus are known from both large adult specimens and small larvae , showing an extreme change in body shape . In these species , the shape and proportions of skull bones change in the early stages of development . The ornamentation on the surface of the skull roof also develops at this time . Small , regularly spaced pits are the first to form , followed by larger ridges . As development continues , the external gills disappear . Small teeth that once covered the palate are lost . The postcranial skeleton does not develop at the same rate as the skull , with ossification ( the replacement of cartilage by bone ) happening more slowly . Vertebrae and limb bones are poorly developed , ribs and fingers are absent in the early stages , and the scapulocoracoid and ischium are entirely absent through most of development . Once maturity is reached , most bones have fully formed and growth rate slows . The bones of some temnospondyls like Dutuitosaurus show growth marks , possibly an indication that growth rate varied with the change in seasons . Fossils of temnospondyls like Metoposaurus and Cheliderpeton show that individuals grew larger past maturity . The oldest individuals usually have more pitting on their skulls with deeper sulci . \\n',\n"," ' One group of temnospondyls , the Branchiosauridae , is also known from larval specimens . Branchiosaurids like Branchiosaurus and Apateon are represented by many fossils preserving skin and external gills . An entire growth series is exhibited in the wide range of sizes among specimens , but the lack of terrestrially adapted adult forms suggests that these temnospondyls were neotenic . Unlike other temnospondyls , their postcranial skeletons developed quickly but were still partly cartilaginous when fully mature . Adults likely had an aquatic lifestyle similar to juveniles . Recently , large specimens of Apateon gracilis were described with adaptations toward a terrestrial lifestyle , indicating that not all branchiosaurs were neotenic . \\n',\n"," \" While most temnospondyls are aquatic in early stages of life , most metoposaurids appear to have been terrestrial in their juvenile stage . Like other Mesozoic temnospondyls , adult metoposaurids were adapted to a semiaquatic lifestyle . Their bones are not highly developed for movement on land . The cross @-@ sectional thickness of limb bones in adult metoposaurids shows that they could not withstand the stress of terrestrial locomotion . Juvenile individuals have bones that are thick enough to withstand this stress , and could probably move about on land . To maintain a terrestrial lifestyle , a temnospondyl 's limb bones would have to thicken with positive allometry , meaning that they would grow at a greater rate than the rest of the body . This is not the case in metoposaurids , meaning that as their bodies grew larger they became less adapted toward a terrestrial lifestyle . \\n\",\n"," ' = = = Hearing = = = \\n',\n"," ' Temnospondyls and other early tetrapods have rounded otic notches in the back of the skull that project into the cheek region . In life , the otic notch would have been covered by a membrane called the tympanum , which is seen as a disk @-@ like area in living frogs . The tympanum is involved in hearing , and is similar to the ear drum of more advanced tetrapods . It was traditionally thought that the tympanum developed very early in tetrapod evolution as a hearing organ and progressed to form the ear drum of amniotes . Thus , temnospondyls possessed a hearing system supposedly ancestral to that of living amphibians and reptiles . \\n',\n"," ' Frogs and all other living tetrapods have a rod @-@ like bone called the stapes that aids in hearing by transferring vibrations from the ear drum — or homologous tympanum — to the inner ear . Temnospondyls also have a stapes , which projects into the otic cavity . The stapes likely evolved from the hyomandibula of lobe @-@ finned fishes . The positioning of the stapes and the shape of the otic region suggests that the tympani of temnospondyls and frogs are homologous , but the tympani of these amphibians are no longer considered homologous with the hearing systems of reptiles , birds , and mammals . Therefore , ear structures in temnospondyls were not ancestral to those of all other tetrapods . \\n',\n"," ' The ability of the tympanum and stapes to effectively transmit vibrations is called impedance matching . Early tetrapods like temnospondyls have thick stapes with poor impedance matching , so it is now thought that they were not used for hearing . Instead , these thick stapes may have functioned to support the tissue that covers the otic notch . Early temnospondyls like Dendrerpeton could not hear airborne sound but would have been able to detect vibration in the ground . Later temnospondyls like Doleserpeton had otic regions adapted to hearing . Doleserpeton has a structure in the inner ear called the perilymphatic duct , which is also seen in frogs and is associated with hearing . Its stapes is also a better transmitter of sound . The hearing system of Doleserpeton and related temnospondyls was able to detect airborne sound and may have been ancestral to that of living amphibians . \\n',\n"," ' = Osbert de Bayeux = \\n',\n"," \" Osbert de Bayeux ( floruit 1121 to 1184 ) was a medieval English cleric and archdeacon in the Diocese of York .

Osbert attempted to have the trial switched to an ecclesiastical court and was supported in his efforts by Archbishop Theobald of Canterbury . A trial was finally held in 1156 and Osbert 's accuser did not produce any witnesses , but Osbert was unable to prove his innocence , prompting the transfer of the case to a papal court .

Use of infrared satellite imagery led to a more objective assessment of the strength of tropical cyclones with eyes , using the cloud top temperatures within the eyewall and contrasting them with the warm temperatures within the eye itself . Constraints on short term intensity change are used less frequently than they were back in the 1970s and 1980s . The central pressures assigned to tropical cyclones have required modification , as the original estimates were 5 @-@ 10 hPa ( 0 @.@ 15 @-@ 0 @.@ 29 inHg ) too low in the Atlantic and up to 20 hPa ( 0 @.@ 59 inHg ) too high in the northwest Pacific .

Development of the objective Dvorak technique began in 1998 , which performed best with tropical cyclones that had eyes ( of hurricane or typhoon strength ) . It still required a manual center placement , keeping some subjectivity within the process . By 2004 , an advanced objective Dvorak technique was developed which utilized banding features for systems below hurricane intensity and to objectively determine the tropical cyclone 's center . A central pressure bias was uncovered in 2004 relating to the slope of the tropopause and cloud top temperatures which change with latitude that helped improve central pressure estimates within the objective technique . \\n\",\n"," ' = = Details of the method = = \\n',\n"," ' In a developing cyclone , the technique takes advantage of the fact that cyclones of similar intensity tend to have certain characteristic features , and as they strengthen , they tend to change in appearance in a predictable manner . The structure and organization of the tropical cyclone are tracked over 24 hours to determine if the storm has weakened , maintained its intensity , or strengthened . Various central cloud and banding features are compared with templates that show typical storm patterns and their associated intensity . If infrared satellite imagery is available for a cyclone with a visible eye pattern , then the technique utilizes the difference between the temperature of the warm eye and the surrounding cold cloud tops to determine intensity ( colder cloud tops generally indicate a more intense storm ) . In each case a \" T @-@ number \" ( an abbreviation for Tropical Number ) and a Current Intensity ( CI ) value are assigned to the storm .

Tropical cyclones with maximum sustained winds between 65 miles per hour ( 105 km / h ) and 100 miles per hour ( 160 km / h ) can have their center of circulations obscured by cloudiness within visible and infrared satellite imagery , which makes diagnosis of their intensity a challenge . \\n',\n"," ' The CCC pattern , with its large and quickly developing mass of thick cirrus clouds spreading out from an area of convection near a tropical cyclone center within a short time frame , indicates little development .

It shows a bust view of a single figure , modeled on Diego Velázquez \\'s Portrait of Innocent X. Bacon applies forceful , expressive brush strokes , and places the figure within a glass cage structure , behind curtain @-@ like drapery . This gives the effect of a man trapped and suffocated by his surroundings , screaming into an airless void . \\n',\n"," ' Head VI was the first of Bacon \\'s paintings to reference Velázquez , whose portrait of Pope Innocent X haunted him throughout his career and inspired his series of \" screaming popes \" , a loose series of which there are around 45 surviving individual works . Head VI contains many motifs that were to reappear in Bacon \\'s work . The hanging object , which may be a light switch or curtain tassel , can be found even in his late paintings . The geometric cage is a motif that appears as late as his 1985 – 86 masterpiece , Study for a Self @-@ Portrait — Triptych . \\n',\n"," ' Head VI was first exhibited in November 1949 at the Hanover Gallery in London , in a showing organised by one of the artist \\'s early champions , Erica Brausen . At the time , Bacon was a highly controversial but respected artist , best known for his 1944 Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion , which made him the enfant terrible of British art . Head VI drew a mixed reaction from art critics ; John Russell , later Bacon \\'s biographer , at the time dismissed it as a cross between \" an alligator shorn of its jaws and an accountant in pince @-@ nez who has come to a bad end \" . In 1989 Lawrence Gowing wrote that the \" shock of the picture , when it was seen with a whole series of heads ... was indescribable . It was everything unpardonable . The paradoxical appearance at once of pastiche and iconoclasm was indeed one of Bacon \\'s most original strokes . \" Art critic and curator David Sylvester described it as a seminal piece from Bacon \\'s unusually productive 1949 – 50 period , and one of Bacon \\'s finest popes . \\n',\n"," ' = = 1949 Head series = = \\n',\n"," ' Bacon \\'s output is characterised by sequences of images . He told Sylvester that his imagination was stimulated by sequences and that \" images breed other images in me \" . His series were not always planned or painted in sequence ; sometimes paintings are grouped for convenience but vary in execution and tone . The idea for the head series came after he returned penniless , late in 1948 , from a stay in Tangier . In the previous three years he had been unable to find a voice ; the last surviving canvas from this period is his Painting ( 1946 ) . Although he continued to paint , he was a ruthless self critic , given to slashing canvases with blades , and no works survive from between 1947 and the winter of 1948 . Gallerist Erica Brausen offered Bacon the opportunity of a solo show for the opening of her new Hanover Gallery . He agreed , but had nothing in reserve to hang . In following years , Brausen became perhaps the most important of Bacon \\'s early champions ; she arranged this showing — his debut solo exhibition — publicised him widely and organised viewings for international buyers . \\n',\n"," ' Already 40 years old , Bacon viewed the exhibition as his last chance and applied himself to the task with determination . Because he had destroyed all his out of the last three years , he had little choice but to present new works . He did not have a grand plan when he agreed to the show , but eventually found themes that interested him in his Head I of the previous year , and executed five progressively stronger variants in the final weeks before the November exhibition , completing the series barely in time for the opening . \\n',\n"," \" The paintings depict isolated figures enclosed in spaces that are undefined , overwhelmingly claustrophobic , reductive and eerie . Coming early in Bacon 's career , they are uneven in quality , but show a clear progression especially in how they utilise and present ideas he was still clearly developing and coming to terms with . Head I ( actually begun in the winter of 1948 ) and Head II show formless pieces of flesh that broadly resemble human heads ; they have half @-@ open eyes and a pharynx , though it is positioned much higher than would be expected in a human . Heads III , IV and V show fully formed busts recognisable as men , and are characterised by a haunted atmosphere . These two broad ideas coalesce in Head VI , which is as physiologically tortured as the first two paintings , and as spectral as the middle three . In Head VI the figure has developed and is now shown wearing vestments , the first indication in Bacon 's work of the influence of Velázquez , while the focus has become the open mouth and the study of the human scream . \\n\",\n"," ' Bacon said that chance played a significant role in his work , and that he often approached a canvas without having a clear idea of what might emerge . This was especially the case in the mid to late 1940s , a period when he was drinking heavily and spending most nights in Soho casinos and poker rooms . The following morning he would often approach his canvas \" in a bad mood of drinking ... under tremendous hangovers and drink ; I sometimes hardly knew what I was doing . \" He incorporated his appetite for chance into his work : an image often would morph mid @-@ way through into something quite different from what he had first intended . He actively sought out this freedom and felt it crucial to his progression as an artist . To him , lifestyle and art were intertwined ; he said that \" perhaps the drink helped me to be a bit freer . \" This is very evident in the 1949 series , which began as a rather morbid study of a collapsed head , but evolved over the six surviving panels into a reworking of Velázquez masterpieces , and arrived at an image that was to preoccupy Bacon for the subsequent 20 years . \\n',\n"," ' The series marks Bacon \\'s first attempt at depicting lone figures in rooms . For him , the key aspect was that it appeared that the subject felt isolated , unobserved , and had abandoned the need to present an outward face . He believed that under these circumstances all pretence falls away , and the social being becomes the sum of its neuroses , which Bacon attempted to convey by reducing the subject to its bare @-@ bones features : a mouth , ears , eyes , a jaw . According to Russell , \" the view out front ceases to be the only one , and our person is suddenly adrift , fragmented , and subject to strange mutation . \" Russell observed that while the depiction of figures in rooms is common through all eras of painting , the figures are always posed , and usually seemingly aware that they are being portrayed . This conceit is abandoned in Bacon \\'s series . \\n',\n"," \" Head I , completed late in 1948 , is considered more successful than Head II . Although it is well @-@ regarded critically , Head II is seen as something of a creative cul @-@ de @-@ sac , while Heads III , IV and V are usually considered as merely intermediate steps towards Head VI . It is exceptional in Bacon 's oeuvre that works of their relative poor quality survive ; he was ruthlessly self @-@ critical and often slashed or abandoned canvasses before they were completed . When pressed again by Brausen in 1953 to produce works for a New York show that she had been publicising for a year , he was full of doubt and destroyed most of what he had been working on , including several other popes . \\n\",\n"," ' Brausen commissioned another showing to be held in 1950 , for which Bacon painted three large popes modelled on Velázquez \\'s portrait . The gallery advertised the show as \" Francis Bacon : Three Studies from the Painting of Innocent X by Velázquez \" , but in the end Bacon was dissatisfied with the works and destroyed them before the show opened . \\n',\n"," ' = = Description = = \\n',\n"," ' The figure is clearly identifiable as a pope from his clothing . It seems trapped and isolated within the outlines of an abstract three @-@ dimensional glass cage . This framing device , described by Sylvester as a \" space @-@ frame \" , was to feature heavily throughout the artist \\'s career . A cord hangs from the upper edge of the glass case , falling just in front of the pope \\'s face and partially covering his eyes . It is too indistinctly drawn to identify with certainty , but given the presence of similar objects in Bacon \\'s later works , may be either the end of a hanging light switch or the tassel of a curtain ; the hanging cord was to become a signature for the artist . Apart from its symbolic meaning , it has a compositional function , framing the painting with a further set of vertical lines . Such an object reappears most prominently in the centre panel of his 1973 Triptych , May – June 1973 , where it is clearly a dangling light bulb . For Bacon , these elements were intended to make the figure waver in and out of sight for the viewer , alluding to the fact that bulbs can be on or off , curtains open or closed . \\n',\n"," ' The figure \\'s mouth is opened wide as if screaming , an expression Bacon took from a still he kept of the nurse screaming in Sergei Eisenstein \\'s Odessa Steps massacre sequence in his 1925 silent film Battleship Potemkin . In 1984 , the broadcaster Melvyn Bragg asked Bacon about the still , and observed that in his earlier career the artist seemed preoccupied with the physicality of the human mouth . Bacon replied , \" I had always thought that I would be able to make the mouth with all the beauty of a Monet landscape though I never succeeded in doing so . \" When Bragg asked why he thought he had failed , Bacon said , \" It should be all much more colour , should have got more of the interior of the mouth , with all the colours of the interior of the mouth , but I didn \\'t happen to get it . \" His interest in the mouth was further stimulated by a medical textbook of diseased oral cavities bought in a second @-@ hand bookshop , kept in his studio and to which he often referred to . \\n',\n"," ' The glass cage might imply a vacuum that the figure \\'s voice is unable to escape ; as if it is screaming in silence . Rueful later in life , Bacon said that he had \" wanted to paint the scream more than the horror . I think , if I had really thought about what causes somebody to really scream , it would have made the scream ... more successful \" . The work evokes memories of the Second World War . The glass enclosure of his 1949 Chicago Study for a Portrait is often seen as prophesying photographs of Adolf Eichmann 1961 trial before a Jerusalem District Court , when he was held within a similar cage . Bacon strongly resisted literal comparisons though , and stated that he used the device so he could frame and \" really see the image – for no other reason . I know it \\'s been interpreted as being many other things . \" Other critics saw similarities between the glass case and the radio booths of late 1930s broadcasters who warned against the impending calamity . Denis Farr notes that Bacon was sympathetic to George Orwell and referred in interviews to Orwellian \" shouting voices ... and trembling hands ... convey [ ing ] the harsh atmosphere of an interrogation . \" \\n',\n"," ' = = Influences = = \\n',\n"," ' The so @-@ called \" space frame \" had already been used by Alberto Giacometti in the 1930s , and the two artists became friends in the 1960s . However Giacometti had by 1949 used it only in surrealist contexts before Bacon \\'s adaption , and in turn influenced his use in \" The Cage \" of 1950 . A similar two dimensional construct is found in Henry Moore \\'s works , notably his \" Maguette for King and Queen \" , constructed three years after Bacon \\'s Head . It is difficult to untangle how these artists influenced and informed each other . What is notable is that Bacon continued to use the motif , with intervals until the end of his life . Sylvester suggests his finest example is the 1970 Three Studies of the Male Back . \\n',\n"," ' The full @-@ length golden curtain @-@ like folds painted in heavy brush strokes are in part influenced by Degas but also similar to Titian \\'s 1558 Portrait of Cardinal Filippo Archinto . Bacon adapts the Old Master \\'s device to isolate and distance the sitter from the viewer ; the black ground @-@ paint is visible through the folds , making the separation all the more affecting . Bacon had already used similar forms in his Chicago panel , and they were to become a feature of his most acclaimed 1950s works , especially in his \" screaming popes \" . He became fascinated with the veil or curtain as a motif in painting , and collected many reproductions of works by Titian and Degas in which it is employed . He had begun his career as an interior decorator and designer of furniture and rugs in the mid @-@ 1930s , and later said that he liked \" rooms hung all round with just curtains hung in even folds \" . Veils or curtains appear in Bacon \\'s earliest works , notably the 1949 Study from the Human Body , always in portraits and always in front of , rather than behind , the figure . \\n',\n"," ' Head VI is closely modelled on Velázquez \\'s c . 1650 Portrait of Innocent X , today in the Doria Pamphilj Gallery , Rome . Bacon cautiously avoided seeing the original , even when he spent three months in Rome in 1954 . Critics speculate he was afraid of being disappointed , or thought that an intimate knowledge of the painting would dull his imagination . Yet his fascination was all @-@ consuming and he reproduced variants of it obsessively for almost two decades ; an examination and homage described as \" without parallel in the history of art \" . Bacon \\'s approach differs to Velázquez \\'s in a number of ways : both artists were expressive , yet Bacon \\'s broad brush @-@ strokes and freedom with paint contrast with Velázquez \\'s tight and controlled treatment . He adapts Velázquez \\'s positioning of the pope to place him above the viewer \\'s point of view , elevating and distancing him . This was already a common technique in commercial , promotional photography but in Bacon \\'s hands , Schmied argues , the angle places the pope on a kind of stage for the viewer to coldly observe . \\n',\n"," ' Although Bacon revered Velázquez \\'s portrait , he did not try and reproduce the earlier painting . In interviews , he said that he saw flaws in Velázquez \\'s work and that he viewed that social structure and order as , according to art historian Wieland Schmied , \" obsolete and decayed \" . Bacon \\'s approach was to elevate his subject so he could knock him down again , thereby making a sly comment on the treatment of royalty in both old master and contemporary painting . Yet Velázquez \\'s influence is apparent in many aspects of the painting . The sitter \\'s pose closely echoes the original , as does the violet and white colouring of his cope , which is built up through broad , thick , brush @-@ strokes . The influence can be further seen in the gold @-@ coloured ornaments on the back of the seat that extend on both sides of the figure . Art historian Armin Zweite describes the work as a mixture of reverence and subversion that pays tribute to Velázquez , while at the same time deconstructs his painting . \\n',\n"," ' Sylvester detects the influence of late works by Titian in other aspects , especially in the deep and rich colouring , Velázquez \\'s portrayals of Philip IV , and agrees with identification of pastels of Edgar Degas as a source . He believes Bacon borrowed from Degas the use of parallel heavy folds to create the illusion of what Degas described as \" shuttering \" , as seen in the earlier artist \\'s After the Bath , Woman drying herself . Sylvester makes a further direct link between the folds and the transparent veil in Titian \\'s Portrait of Cardinal Filippo Archinto . He believes the folds serve to \" push the viewer back \" , creating a distance from the subject , an effect he sees as similar to the separation between and orchestra and setting ; others view the folds as more closely resembling the bars of a prison . Sylvester describes them as an accentuation of background verticals into stripes that are made to appear as if they pass through the sitter . In his \" Interviews with Francis Bacon \" series of books , he asked Bacon why he found the effect so poignant . The artist replied , \" Well , it means that the sensation doesn \\'t come straight out at you but slides slowly and gently through the gaps . \" \\n',\n"," ' When asked why he was compelled to revisit the Velázquez so often , Bacon replied that he had nothing against popes per se , but merely sought \" an excuse to use these colours , and you can \\'t give ordinary clothes that purple colour without getting into a sort of false fauve manner . \" Schmied sees Head VI as a reaction against Velázquez , and a commentary on how the papacy is \" obsolete and decayed \" , with a pope resistant to both modernisation and secularisation . To him , the figure seems to \" resist the maltreatment of image and tries to halt the impending collapse of the established work order . He screams and grimaces , clutching at arms of his throne . \" Sylvester notes that Bacon was impressed by Picasso \\'s figuration and handling of paint , especially in Picasso \\'s 1930s works ; and suggests that the white blobs around the pope \\'s cape may be influenced by the 1913 Woman in a Slip Seated in an Armchair . \\n',\n"," ' = = Critical reception = = \\n',\n"," ' When Bacon undertook the series late in 1948 he was something of a two @-@ hit wonder . He had success in 1944 with Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion and to a lesser extent with Painting ( 1946 ) , both of which were highly regarded but viewed as sensationalist . The exhibition was a success , and marked his critical breakthrough . Until then , he had been highly regarded but capable of only occasional brilliance . The full show established him in the minds of critics as , according to Michael Peppiatt , \" more of a force to be reckoned with in the contemporary scene \" . While some found his images horrifying and unnerving , they wrote about him all the same , sealing his reputation as the enfant terrible of post @-@ war British art . The critic for The Observer wrote , \" The recent paintings ... horrifying as they are , cannot be ignored . Technically they are superb , and the masterly handling of large areas of pearly grey , flushed with a sudden pink or green , only makes me regret the more that the artist \\'s gift should have been brought to subjects so esoteric \" . \\n',\n"," ' Most critics focused on Heads I and VI , remarking favourably on the progression between the two . While some found the inherent violence of the paintings distasteful , Brausen was a skilled publicist and turned the bad press into notoriety , and brought Bacon \\'s work to national attention . Peppiatt notes that the exhibition showed Bacon no longer needed sensationalist material to make an impact , and was now capable of creating an intense emotional response through more subtle means , and had found a way of presenting the human condition in the way he had sought , by presenting his sitter \" in a vestigial setting , a cage or [ behind ] a parted curtin ... the rest , the most essential , lay in the manipulation of the infinitely suggestive medium of oil paint \" . After the showing Bacon gradually became \" less the outsider with an occasional image of horrifying brilliance and more a force to be reckoned with on the contemporary scene \" . His reputation and the value of his panels rose dramatically , and after the showing he was sought after by European , American and African collectors and galleries , commanding prices as high as £ 400 for single works , unusual for a contemporary British artist of the time . \\n',\n"," ' = = Provenance = = \\n',\n"," \" Head VI was first exhibited at the Hanover Gallery , London , in 1949 .

Peppiatt believes that Bacon would have disapproved of such a showing with a work he considered one of the finest ever painted , but writes that two , including Head VI , \" stood up to it , and even enhanced its authority as one of the most penetrating studies of human nature and human power \" . \\n',\n"," ' = Imagism = \\n',\n"," ' Imagism was a movement in early 20th @-@ century Anglo @-@ American poetry that favored precision of imagery and clear , sharp language . \\n',\n"," \" Imagism has been described as the most influential movement in English poetry since the activity of the Pre @-@ Raphaelites . As a poetic style it gave Modernism its start in the early 20th century , and is considered to be the first organized Modernist literary movement in the English language . Imagism is sometimes viewed as ' a succession of creative moments ' rather than any continuous or sustained period of development . René Taupin remarked that ' It is more accurate to consider Imagism not as a doctrine , nor even as a poetic school , but as the association of a few poets who were for a certain time in agreement on a small number of important principles ' . \\n\",\n"," ' The Imagists rejected the sentiment and discursiveness typical of much Romantic and Victorian poetry , in contrast to their contemporaries , the Georgian poets , who were generally content to work within that tradition . In contrast , Imagism called for a return to what were seen as more Classical values , such as directness of presentation and economy of language , as well as a willingness to experiment with non @-@ traditional verse forms . Imagists use free verse . \\n',\n"," ' Imagist publications appearing between 1914 and 1917 featured works by many of the most prominent modernist figures , both in poetry and in other fields . The Imagist group was centered in London , with members from Great Britain , Ireland and the United States . Somewhat unusually for the time , a number of women writers were major Imagist figures . \\n',\n"," ' A characteristic feature of Imagism is its attempt to isolate a single image to reveal its essence . This feature mirrors contemporary developments in avant @-@ garde art , especially Cubism . Although Imagism isolates objects through the use of what Ezra Pound called \" luminous details \" , Pound \\'s Ideogrammic Method of juxtaposing concrete instances to express an abstraction is similar to Cubism \\'s manner of synthesizing multiple perspectives into a single image . \\n',\n"," ' = = Pre @-@ Imagism = = \\n',\n"," \" Well @-@ known poets of the Edwardian era of the 1890s , such as Alfred Austin , Stephen Phillips , and William Watson , had been working very much in the shadow of Tennyson , producing weak imitations of the poetry of the Victorian era . They continued to work in this vein into the early years of the 20th century . As the new century opened , Austin was still the serving British Poet Laureate , a post which he held up to 1913 . In the century 's first decade , poetry still had a large audience ; volumes of verse published in that time included Thomas Hardy 's The Dynasts , Christina Rossetti 's posthumous Poetical Works , Ernest Dowson 's Poems , George Meredith 's Last Poems , Robert Service 's Ballads of a Cheechako and John Masefield 's Ballads and Poems . Future Nobel Prize winner William Butler Yeats was devoting much of his energy to the Abbey Theatre and writing for the stage , producing relatively little lyric poetry during this period . In 1907 , the Nobel Prize for Literature was awarded to Rudyard Kipling . \\n\",\n"," ' The origins of Imagism are to be found in two poems , Autumn and A City Sunset by T. E. Hulme . These were published in January 1909 by the Poets \\' Club in London in a booklet called For Christmas MDCCCCVIII . Hulme was a student of mathematics and philosophy ; he had been involved in the setting up of the club in 1908 and was its first secretary . Around the end of 1908 , he presented his paper A Lecture on Modern Poetry at one of the club \\'s meetings . Writing in A. R. Orage \\'s magazine The New Age , the poet and critic F. S. Flint ( a champion of free verse and modern French poetry ) was highly critical of the club and its publications . From the ensuing debate , Hulme and Flint became close friends . In 1909 , Hulme left the Poets \\' Club and started meeting with Flint and other poets in a new group which Hulme referred to as the \" Secession Club \" ; they met at the Eiffel Tower restaurant in London \\'s Soho to discuss plans to reform contemporary poetry through free verse and the tanka and haiku and the removal of all unnecessary verbiage from poems . The interest in Japanese verse forms can be placed in a context of the late Victorian and Edwardian revival of interest in Chinoiserie and Japonism as witnessed in the 1890s vogue for William Anderson \\'s Japanese prints donated to the British Museum , performances of Noh plays in London , and the success of Gilbert and Sullivan \\'s operetta The Mikado ( 1885 ) . Direct literary models were available from a number of sources , including F. V. Dickins \\'s 1866 Hyak nin is \\'shiu , or , Stanzas by a Century of Poets , Being Japanese Lyrical Odes , the first English @-@ language version of the Hyakunin isshu , a 13th @-@ century anthology of 100 waka , the early 20th @-@ century critical writings and poems of Sadakichi Hartmann , and contemporary French @-@ language translations . \\n',\n"," ' The American poet Ezra Pound was introduced to the group in April 1909 and found that their ideas were close to his own . In particular , Pound \\'s studies of Romantic literature had led him to an admiration of the condensed , direct expression that he detected in the writings of Arnaut Daniel , Dante , and Guido Cavalcanti , amongst others . For example , in his 1911 – 12 series of essays I gather the limbs of Osiris , Pound writes of Daniel \\'s line \" pensar de lieis m \\'es repaus \" ( \" it rests me to think of her \" ) ( from the canzone En breu brizara \\'l temps braus ) : \" You cannot get statement simpler than that , or clearer , or less rhetorical \" . These criteria of directness , clarity and lack of rhetoric were to be amongst the defining qualities of Imagist poetry . Through his friendship with Laurence Binyon , Pound had already developed an interest in Japanese art by examining Nishiki @-@ e prints at the British Museum , and he quickly became absorbed in the study of related Japanese verse forms . \\n',\n"," \" In an article in La France , 1915 , the French critic , Remy de Gourmont described the Imagists as descendants of the French Symbolistes and in a 1928 letter to the French critic and translator René Taupin , Pound was keen to emphasise another ancestry for Imagism , pointing out that Hulme was indebted to a Symbolist tradition , linking back via William Butler Yeats , Arthur Symons and the Rhymers ' Club generation of British poets to Mallarmé. and the Symbolist source was amplified further in Taupin 's study published in 1929 , in which he concluded however great the divergence of technique and language ' between the image of the Imagist and the ' symbol ' of the Symbolists there is a difference only of precision ' . In 1915 , Pound edited the poetry of another 1890s poet , Lionel Johnson for the publisher Elkin Mathews . In his introduction , he wrote \\n\",\n"," ' = = Early publications and statements of intent = = \\n',\n"," ' In 1911 , Pound introduced two other poets to the Eiffel Tower group : his former fiancée Hilda Doolittle ( who had started signing her work H.D. ) and her future husband Richard Aldington . These two were interested in exploring Greek poetic models , especially Sappho , an interest that Pound shared . The compression of expression that they achieved by following the Greek example complemented the proto @-@ Imagist interest in Japanese poetry , and , in 1912 , during a meeting with them in the British Museum tea room , Pound told H.D. and Aldington that they were Imagistes and even appended the signature H.D. Imagiste to some poems they were discussing . \\n',\n"," \" When Harriet Monroe started her Poetry magazine in 1911 , she had asked Pound to act as foreign editor . In October 1912 , he submitted thereto three poems each by H.D. and Aldington under the Imagiste rubric , ( published in the November 1912 second issue thereof ) with a note which described Aldington as ' one of the ' Imagistes ' . This note , along with the appendix note ( ' The Complete Works of T. S. Hulme ' ) in Pound 's book ( also published in Autumn 1912 ) entitled Ripostes are considered to be first appearances of the word Imagiste ( later anglicised to ' Imagists ' ) in print . \\n\",\n"," ' Aldington \\'s poems , Choricos , To a Greek Marble , and Au Vieux Jardin , were in the November issue of Poetry , and H.D. \\' s , Hermes of the Ways , Priapus , and Epigram , appeared in the January 1913 issue ; Imagism as a movement was launched . Poetry \\'s April issue published what came to be seen as \" Imagism \\'s enabling text \" , the haiku @-@ like poem of Ezra Pound entitled \" In a Station of the Metro \" : \\n',\n"," ' The apparition of these faces in the crowd ; \\n',\n"," ' Petals on a wet , black bough . \\n',\n"," \" The March 1913 issue of Poetry contained A Few Don 'ts by an Imagiste and the essay entitled Imagisme both written by Pound , with the latter being attributed to Flint . The latter contained this succinct statement of the group 's position : \\n\",\n"," ' Direct treatment of the \" thing \" , whether subjective or objective . \\n',\n"," ' To use absolutely no word that does not contribute to the presentation . \\n',\n"," ' As regarding rhythm : to compose in sequence of the musical phrase , not in sequence of the metronome . \\n',\n"," ' Pound \\'s note opened with a definition of an image as \" that which presents an intellectual and emotional complex in an instant of time \" . Pound goes on to state , \" It is better to present one Image in a lifetime than to produce voluminous works \" . His list of \" don \\'ts \" reinforced his three statements in \" Imagism \" , while warning that they should not be considered as dogma but as the \" result of long contemplation \" . Taken together , these two texts comprised the Imagist programme for a return to what they saw as the best poetic practice of the past . F.S. Flint commented \" we have never claimed to have invented the moon . We do not pretend that our ideas are original . \" \\n',\n"," ' The 1916 preface to Some Imagist Poets comments \" Imagism does not merely mean the presentation of pictures . Imagism refers to the manner of presentation , not to the subject . \" \\n',\n"," ' = = Des Imagistes = = \\n',\n"," \" Determined to promote the work of the Imagists , and particularly of Aldington and H.D. , Pound decided to publish an anthology under the title Des Imagistes . It was first published in Alfred Kreymborg 's little magazine The Glebe and was later published in 1914 by Alfred and Charles Boni in New York and by Harold Monro at the Poetry Bookshop in London . It became one of the most important and influential English @-@ language collections of modernist verse . Included in the thirty @-@ seven poems were ten poems by Aldington , seven by H.D. , and six by Pound . The book also included work by F.S. Flint , Skipwith Cannell , Amy Lowell , William Carlos Williams , James Joyce , Ford Madox Ford , Allen Upward and John Cournos.Max Michelson was also another included in the important 1963 anthology by William Pratt The Imagist Poem Modern Poetry in miniature . \\n\",\n"," \" Pound 's editorial choices were based on what he saw as the degree of sympathy that these writers displayed with Imagist precepts , rather than active participation in a group as such . Williams , who was based in the United States , had not participated in any of the discussions of the Eiffel Tower group . However , he and Pound had long been corresponding on the question of the renewal of poetry along similar lines . Ford was included at least partly because of his strong influence on Pound , as the younger poet made the transition from his earlier , Pre @-@ Raphaelite @-@ influenced style towards a harder , more modern way of writing . The inclusion of a poem by Joyce , I Hear an Army , which was sent to Pound by W.B. Yeats , took on a wider importance in the history of literary modernism , as the subsequent correspondence between the two led to the serial publication , at Pound 's behest , of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man in The Egoist . Joyce 's poem is not written in free verse , but in rhyming quatrains . However , it strongly reflects Pound 's interest in poems written to be sung to music , such as those by the troubadours and Guido Cavalcanti . The book met with little popular or critical success , at least partly because it had no introduction or commentary to explain what the poets were attempting to do , and a number of copies were returned to the publisher . \\n\",\n"," ' = = Some Imagist Poets = = \\n',\n"," ' The following year , Pound and Flint fell out over their different interpretations of the history and goals of the group arising from an article on the history of Imagism written by Flint and published in The Egoist in May 1915 . Flint was at pains to emphasise the contribution of the Eiffel Tower poets , especially Edward Storer . Pound , who believed that the \" Hellenic hardness \" that he saw as the distinguishing quality of the poems of H.D. and Aldington was likely to be diluted by the \" custard \" of Storer , was to play no further direct role in the history of the Imagists . He went on to co @-@ found the Vorticists with his friend , the painter and writer Wyndham Lewis . \\n',\n"," ' Around this time , the American Imagist Amy Lowell moved to London , determined to promote her own work and that of the other Imagist poets . Lowell was a wealthy heiress from Boston whose brother Abbott Lawrence Lowell was President of Harvard University from 1909 @-@ 1933 . She loved Keats and cigars . She was also an enthusiastic champion of literary experiment who was willing to use her money to publish the group . Lowell was determined to change the method of selection from Pound \\'s autocratic editorial attitude to a more democratic manner . This new editorial policy was stated in the Preface to the first anthology to appear under her leadership : \" In this new book we have followed a slightly different arrangement to that of our former Anthology . Instead of an arbitrary selection by an editor , each poet has been permitted to represent himself by the work he considers his best , the only stipulation being that it should not yet have appeared in book form . \" The outcome was a series of Imagist anthologies under the title Some Imagist Poets . The first of these appeared in 1915 , planned and assembled mainly by H.D. and Aldington . Two further issues , both edited by Lowell , were published in 1916 and 1917 . These three volumes featured most of the original poets , ( also including imagist poetry by the American poet John Gould Fletcher ) , with the exception of Pound , who had tried to persuade her to drop the Imagist name from her publications and who sardonically dubbed this phase of Imagism \" Amy @-@ gism . \" \\n',\n"," ' Lowell persuaded D. H. Lawrence to contribute poems to the 1915 and 1916 volumes , making him the only writer to publish as both a Georgian poet and an Imagist . Marianne Moore also became associated with the group during this period . However , with World War I as a backdrop , the times were not easy for avant @-@ garde literary movements ( Aldington , for example , spent much of the war at the front ) , and the 1917 anthology effectively marked the end of the Imagists as a movement . \\n',\n"," ' = = Imagists after Imagism = = \\n',\n"," ' In 1929 , Walter Lowenfels jokingly suggested that Aldington should produce a new Imagist anthology . Aldington , by now a successful novelist , took up the suggestion and enlisted the help of Ford and H.D. The result was the Imagist Anthology 1930 , edited by Aldington and including all the contributors to the four earlier anthologies with the exception of Lowell , who had died , Cannell , who had disappeared , and Pound , who declined . The appearance of this anthology initiated a critical discussion of the place of the Imagists in the history of 20th @-@ century poetry . \\n',\n"," ' Of the poets who were published in the various Imagist anthologies , Joyce , Lawrence and Aldington are now primarily remembered and read as novelists . Marianne Moore , who was at most a fringe member of the group , carved out a unique poetic style of her own that retained an Imagist concern with compression of language . William Carlos Williams developed his poetic along distinctly American lines with his variable foot and a diction he claimed was taken \" from the mouths of Polish mothers \" . Both Pound and H.D. turned to writing long poems , but retained much of the hard edge to their language as an Imagist legacy . Most of the other members of the group are largely forgotten outside the context of the history of Imagism . \\n',\n"," ' = = Legacy = = \\n',\n"," ' Despite the movement \\'s short life , Imagism would deeply influence the course of modernist poetry in English . Richard Aldington , in his 1941 memoir , writes : \" I think the poems of Ezra Pound , D.H. , Lawrence , and Ford Madox Ford will continue to be read . And to a considerable extent T. S. Eliot and his followers have carried on their operations from positions won by the Imagists . \" \\n',\n"," ' On the other hand , Wallace Stevens found shortcomings in the Imagist approach : \" Not all objects are equal . The vice of imagism was that it did not recognize this . \" With its demand for hardness , clarity and precision and its insistence on fidelity to appearances coupled with its rejection of irrelevant subjective emotions Imagism had later effects that are demonstratable in T. S. Eliot \\'s \\' Preludes \\' and \\' Morning at the Window \\' and in D. H. Lawrence \\'s animal and flower pieces . The rejection of conventional verse forms in the nineteen @-@ twenties owed much to the Imagists repudiation of the Georgian Poetry style . \\n',\n"," ' The influence of Imagism can be seen clearly in the work of the Objectivist poets , who came to prominence in the 1930s under the auspices of Pound and Williams . The Objectivists worked mainly in free verse . Clearly linking Objectivism \\'s principles with Imagism \\'s , Louis Zukofsky insisted , in his introduction to the 1931 Objectivist issue of Poetry , on writing \" which is the detail , not mirage , of seeing , of thinking with the things as they exist , and of directing them along a line of melody . \" Zukofsky was a major influence on the Language poets , who carried the Imagist focus on formal concerns to a high level of development . Basil Bunting , another Objectivist poet , was a key figure in the early development of the British Poetry Revival , a loose movement that also absorbed the influence of the San Francisco Renaissance poets . \\n',\n"," ' Imagism influenced a number of poetry circles and movements.With the Imagists Free verse became a discipline and acquired status as a legitimate poetic form . In the 1950s , especially , with the Beat generation , the Black Mountain poets , and others associated with the San Francisco Renaissance . In his seminal 1950 essay Projective Verse , Charles Olson , the theorist of the Black Mountain group , wrote \" ONE PERCEPTION MUST IMMEDIATELY AND DIRECTLY LEAD TO A FURTHER PERCEPTION \" ; his credo derived from and supplemented the Imagists . \\n',\n"," \" Among the Beats , Gary Snyder and Allen Ginsberg in particular were influenced by the Imagist emphasis on Chinese and Japanese poetry . William Carlos Williams was another who had a strong effect on the Beat poets , encouraging poets like Lew Welch and writing an introduction for the book publication of Ginsberg 's Howl ( 1955 ) . \\n\",\n"," ' = Operation Eastern Exit = \\n',\n"," ' Operation Eastern Exit was the codename given to the military evacuation of the United States embassy in Mogadishu , the capital of Somalia , in January 1991 .

On 1 January 1991 , the US Ambassador to Somalia , James Keough Bishop , contacted the Department of State requesting an evacuation of the embassy , which was approved the following day . United States Central Command began planning and mobilizing forces that evening .

About 3 @,@ 600 Americans were evacuated in 33 hours ; Bishop was one of 26 diplomats and soldiers that remained in the city .

During his previous assignment as Ambassador to Liberia ( 1987 – 90 ) , Bishop was overseeing the voluntary evacuation of embassy staff and civilians as a civil war in Liberia spread , when he left in March 1990 . Soon after returning to Washington to prepare for his new appointment to Somalia , he was appointed to a taskforce to deal with the crisis in Liberia , which included a gradual evacuation of American civilians and a rapid closure of the embassy in August . \\n\",\n"," ' On 1 August , before leaving the US to take up his post in Mogadishu , Ambassador Bishop visited United States Central Command — the military command for the Middle East and northeast Africa — where he spent most of the day with its commander , Gen.

He feared that the embassy would be targeted by organized attacks if any group involved in the clashes got the impression that the US was intervening in the conflict . To this effect , he requested the Voice of America and BBC broadcast announcements that the forces were present only to evacuate the embassy and would not interfere in the conflict . The Marines who had been doused in fuel during the refueling were able to take a shower and wash their clothes . \\n',\n"," ' After an hour on the ground , the helicopters left with the first 61 evacuees , including all American civilians and four heads of mission .

The Soviet Union was unable to land a plane in Mogadishu the previous day and the Soviet ambassador asked Ambassador Bishop if he and his staff could be rescued ; Ambassador Bishop , a tennis partner of his Soviet counterpart , agreed but only if they found their own way to the embassy . Seeing the helicopters on the morning of 5 January , they realized the Americans would not remain in the city much longer . At the request of Ambassador Bishop , Major Siad agreed to transport the Soviets , but only if he was paid enough ; the US embassy paid Major Siad , who returned with the Soviet ambassador and 38 of his staff . The brother of President Barre , who was also a Major General and Chief of Police , showed up at the embassy in the afternoon with 25 members of his family requesting to be evacuated , but was turned away after a vocal conversation with the ambassador . \\n\",\n"," ' The operation did not include soldiers to handle the evacuation control center ( ECC ) , which was set up in the JAO .

Major Siad demanded that the evacuation cease immediately because the Somali government had not granted the US permission to carry out such a military operation . He claimed that he would radio soldiers to shoot down the helicopters if the operation continued . The second and third waves were able to depart without incident as the ambassador negotiated with the Major , who finally agreed to settle the matter for several thousand dollars in cash and keys to the ambassador 's armored car . Ambassador Bishop remained engaged in conversation with the Major until he reached the helicopter landing zone to depart with the final wave to prevent the Major from reneging on the deal .

Ambassador Bishop tried unsuccessfully to have these employees airlifted to safer parts of Somalia . Many of the FSNs had sought refuge in the embassy with their families and about 30 were hired as guards and protected the embassy throughout the ordeal . Local banks had been closed for some time and the embassy was unable to pay the FSNs .

When promoting the album Arjona said , \" [ songs ] are like women ; they get things up and are so concerned about this that they forget that the less clothes , more beauty . The songs are often overwhelmed by ourselves , because we saturate them with arrangements looking to exalt their qualities and we end up hiding them \" . Poquita Ropa became the first album since Adentro which Arjona recorded without Torres . \\n',\n"," ' Weeks before the release of Independiente , Arjona issued a letter raising the issue of his past relationships with recording companies .

Arjona further explained that he received the \" minimum royalty percentage \" from his most successful albums .

Torres then \" went all out on the first demo , hiring a full band that included a string orchestra \" . In Quién Dijo Ayer ( 2007 ) , Torres produced the singles \" Quién \" and \" Quiero \" and provided background vocals on the remastered versions of Arjona \\'s past hits .

In a February 2012 interview , Arjona stated that \" El Amor \" was the \" most tawdry \" song he had released to date , explaining that their choice of the song was a \" contradiction \" because it was not \" the song which could better represent the entire album \" .

He described Moreno as \" incredibly talented \" , a \" countrywoman \" and a \" fantastic human being \" . Arjona named \" Fuiste Tú \" as one of the most important songs on the album . \" Mi Novia Se Me Está Poniendo Vieja \" took two years to complete and Arjona dedicated it to his mother , Noemí Morales .

As with his single \" Señora De Las Cuatro Decadas \" ( on 1994 \\'s Historias ) , at first he never thought to include the song on an album . \" Caudillo \" evokes \" the image of some friends \" Arjona had at college ; he asserted that he \" appears constantly there because sometimes we transform ourselves into a contradiction of all those things we fought in those moments .

Though every month with the exception of February and March featured tropical activity , most storms developed from May through October . During the season , tropical cyclones affected the Philippines , Japan , China , the Korean Peninsula , Indochina , and various islands in the western Pacific . \\n',\n"," ' The season ran year @-@ round , with the first storm , Yanyan , developing west of the Marshall Islands on January 15 . In April , Typhoon Kujira became one of the longest @-@ lasting Pacific typhoons in history and attained climatological records for its unusually early impacts . Typhoon Imbudo in July caused several deaths and extensive damage across the Philippines and China . In September , Typhoon Maemi became one of the costliest typhoons in recorded history after striking South Korea ; Maemi was also the most intense tropical cyclone of the season with a minimum barometric pressure of 910 mbar ( hPa ; 26 @.@ 87 inHg ) . In late November , Typhoon Lupit devastated areas of Yap State in the Federated States of Micronesia . The season closed with the dissipation of a tropical depression east of the Philippines on December 27 . \\n',\n"," ' The scope of this article is limited to the Pacific Ocean , north of the equator and west of the International Date Line . Storms that form east of the date line and north of the equator are called hurricanes ; see 2003 Pacific hurricane season . Tropical Storms formed in the entire west Pacific basin are assigned a name by the Tokyo Typhoon Center . Tropical depressions in this basin monitored by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) have the \" W \" suffix added to their number . Tropical depressions that enter or form in the Philippine area of responsibility are assigned a name by the Philippine Atmospheric , Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration or PAGASA . This can often result in the same storm having two names . \\n',\n"," ' = = Seasonal forecasts = = \\n',\n"," ' On March 5 , 2003 , meteorologists from the University College London at the Tropical Storm Risk ( TSR ) Consortium issued an extended range forecast for the typhoon season , noting the likelihood of near average tropical cyclone activity as a result of projected neutral sea surface temperatures . The forecast indicated the potential for 26 @.@ 2 tropical storms , compared to the 10 – and 30 @-@ year average of 27 @.@ 8 and 26 @.@ 3 storms , respectively . The following month , the group raised their forecast for tropical storms to 26 @.@ 7 , indicating a slightly above average season . Over next two months , however , fluctuations in sea surface temperatures , particularly those in the Central Pacific , caused the group to revise their predictions downward and indicated the probability for a slightly below average typhoon season in their June forecast . A rise in sea surface temperatures in the following months prompted the forecasting group to once again raise their forecasts to indicate a near @-@ average season in their final August forecast update , which predicted 27 tropical storms . The group was very accurate in their forecasts , with their April and August forecasts being the most accurate . \\n',\n"," ' Similarly , meteorologists working with the City University of Hong Kong issued a seasonal projection on April 24 , 2003 , indicating the likelihood of a normal or below normal season with 29 total tropical cyclones , 26 tropical storms , and 16 typhoons . As with the TSR , the group primarily based their forecast numbers on the prevailing status of the El Niño @-@ Southern Oscillation . The City University of Hong Kong revised their forecasts on June 24 , 2003 , indicating a slight increase of total tropical cyclones to 30 . The group was also accurate in their forecasts for the entirety of the Northwest Pacific , though their specialized forecasts for the South China Sea were substantially off . \\n',\n"," \" During the year , the Japan Meteorological Agency ( JMA ) issued advisories on tropical cyclones west of the International Date Line to the Malay Peninsula , and north of the equator ; this was due to the agency 's status as the official Regional Specialized Meteorological Center , as designated by the World Meteorological Organization in 1989 . The JMA issued forecasts and analyses four times a day , beginning at 0000 UTC and continuing every six hours . The JMA issued forecasts based on a climatological tropical cyclone forecast model . The agency estimated 10 minute sustained winds and barometric pressure based on the Dvorak technique and numerical weather prediction . The JTWC also issued warnings on storms within the basin , operating from Pearl Harbor in Hawaii to represent the interests of the United States Armed Forces in the Indian and Pacific Oceans . \\n\",\n"," ' = = Season summary = = \\n',\n"," ' Throughout the season , sea surface temperatures within the western equatorial Pacific were above normal , including those in the South China Sea . Areas of convection persisted year @-@ round in the lower latitudes , particularly around the Philippines . Atmospheric divergence was also prevalent in the same regions , resulting in enhanced tropical cyclogenesis east of the Philippines in 2003 ; the mean region of development of tropical systems during the year was more southwest than the 1971 – 2000 30 @-@ year average . In 2003 , the JMA monitored 21 tropical cyclones of at least tropical storm intensity ; of those , 14 reached typhoon intensity . Though the number of tropical storms was below average , the ratio between tropical storms and typhoons was 66 % greater than normal . The Philippine Atmospheric , Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration ( PAGASA ) monitored three additional cyclones of at least tropical storm intensity that were not monitored by the JMA . \\n',\n"," ' The season began with the formation of Tropical Storm Yanyan on January 15 . After its dissipation five days later , no tropical cyclones of at least tropical storm intensity developed over the next two months . This period of inactivity ended with the formation of Typhoon Kujira in mid @-@ April ; Kujira was one of the longest lived Pacific storms on record and was the first typhoon with 1 @-@ minute sustained winds of at least 240 km / h ( 150 mph ) in April since Typhoon Isa in 1997 . Tropical activity was enhanced from May to June , and during this period the JMA monitored four tropical storms , while the PAGASA monitored a fifth storm off the eastern Philippines . Three of the four tropical storms monitored by the JMA approached or hit Japan , including Typhoon Soudelor , which brought heavy rainfall and wind across the Ryukyu Islands and the Korean Peninsula . \\n',\n"," ' Tropical activity once again declined towards the second half of June and first half of July . The second half of July , however , featured the development of typhoons Imbudo and Koni , which both tracked westward across the Philippines before striking areas near Saipan and other regions of southeastern China . Imbudo caused the deaths of 78 people and US $ 383 million in damage . August was a highly active month for tropical cyclogenesis , with a total of six tropical storms monitored by the JMA , JTWC , and PAGASA . This included typhoons Krovanh and Dujuan , which also struck southeastern China . Typhoon Etau earlier in the month made landfall in Japan , resulting in 17 deaths . \\n',\n"," ' Activity was somewhat below average in September , with only one tropical cyclone making landfall , Maemi . However , Maemi was the strongest tropical cyclone of the season and was the costliest with roughly US $ 4 @.@ 8 billion in damage , mostly in South Korea . Tropical cyclogenesis and activity continued to decline after August , with October featuring only three tropical storms . However , two , Ketsana and Parma , reached typhoon intensity ; both stayed away from land . November featured less storms but was climatologically average , with two typhoons developing . The second typhoon , Lupit , devastated portions of Yap State , resulting in approximately $ 1 @.@ 7 million in damage . In December , the JTWC and PAGASA monitored a sole tropical system east of the Philippines , though the JMA did not monitor or classify any tropical cyclones during the month . \\n',\n"," ' = = Storms = = \\n',\n"," ' In storm information below , wind @-@ speed advisories differ from the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) to the JMA as the JTWC uses the United States criteria of 1 @-@ minute mean to designate maximum sustained winds , while the JMA uses the 10 @-@ minute mean wind criteria to designate tropical cyclone maximum sustained winds . This difference generally results in JTWC maximum winds appearing higher than the maximum winds described by the JMA for the same cyclone . \\n',\n"," ' = = = Tropical Storm Yanyan = = = \\n',\n"," ' On January 11 , the JTWC began monitoring the disturbance that would eventually develop into Yanyan near the International Date Line . As the system tracked westward , it gradually moved into a more favorable environment for tropical cyclogenesis . On January 14 , surface observations indicated that the low @-@ pressure area had developed a closed , low @-@ level circulation center indicative of a tropical cyclone , satellite imagery remained inconclusive . Nonetheless , the JMA classified the pressure area as a tropical depression west of the Marshall Islands at 0600 UTC on January 15 . The JTWC would follow suit by classifying the storm as such at 1800 UTC later that day . At the time , the depression was tracking west @-@ northwest under the influence of a subtropical ridge to the north . Over the next day the system waned in convective activity before resuming its previous track and accelerating . At 0000 UTC on January 17 , the JTWC upgraded the system to tropical storm intensity , though the storm remained nameless as the JMA continued to classify it as a tropical depression . \\n',\n"," ' Throughout January 17 the tropical storm would again oscillate in strength , resulting in a brief downgrade by the JTWC to tropical depression intensity . However , an increase in deep convection resulted in its reclassification as a tropical storm at 1800 UTC that day , followed by the JMA upgrading the system to tropical storm intensity at 1200 UTC on January 18 . As such , the storm received the name Yanyan . At roughly the same time , the tropical cyclone began to stall east of the Mariana Islands and curve sharply northeastward . Whilst the JTWC indicated that Yanyan peaked in strength late on January 18 with 1 @-@ minute sustained winds of 60 km / h ( 37 mph ) , the JMA considered the system to have maintained the same intensity throughout its stint as a tropical storm . Steered by the same nearby subtropical ridge , Yanyan would continue to track towards the northeast into a less favorable tropical cyclone environment . The JMA downgraded Yanyan to tropical depression at 1200 UTC on January 20 before the storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone as its low @-@ level circulation center decoupled from the primary mass of convection due to strong wind shear . At 0000 UTC , both the JTWC and JMA discontinued the monitoring of Yanyan . \\n',\n"," ...]"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":34}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def mask_vowels(text,
